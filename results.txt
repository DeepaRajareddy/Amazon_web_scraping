	1.My primary goal when I'm teaching A Tale of Two Cities to my sophomores is to make them realize that Charles Dickens didn't write creaky, dusty long novels that teachers embraced as a twisted rite of passage for teenagers. Instead, I want them them to understand why Dickens was one of the most popular writers in England and America during his time. I want them to see the book as the suspenseful, comedic, and sentimental piece of entertainment that it is. Because, while A Tale of Two Cities is masterfully written with sly humor, densely meaningful descriptions, a cast of quirky characters only Dickens could create, an endless series of telling binaries and foils, and relevant social commentary about the French Revolution as well as Dickens' time, it is also simply a damn good story. By a damn good storyteller. I have a difficult time writing reviews about books that I adore because, when I'm not reading them, I hug them too closely to be very critical. (BTW - I frequently hug A Tale of Two Cities in front of my students... and write Charles Dickens' name with hearts around it... They think I'm crazy, but it intrigues some of them just enough to make them doubt the derisive comments of upperclassmen.) I reluctantly admit that Dickens does oversimplify the causes of the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror; however, in doing so, he successfully captures the spirit of a tumultuous period and helps readers sympathize with characters on every side of the developing conflict. I also think that the characters of Roger Cly and John Barsad get a bit messy and may have worked better as a single character. Perhaps the confusion is a result of serialization restructuring. But, really, I read A Tale of Two Cities like a costumed Lord of the Rings fan at a movie premier. I cheer when my favorite characters enter scenes and I knowingly laugh when Dickens cleverly foreshadows future events. Though I don't think that A Tale of Two Cities is Dickens' best novel--that title I would reserve for either Bleak House or David Copperfield--I do agree with Dickens, who claims that it was his best story. It is artfully written. Dickens introduces a cast of characters, sprawled across two nations and spanning varied social classes and political affiliations, and then effortlessly weaves their stories and secrets together in a masterful way. The Modernist movement painstakingly forced literature to reflect the ambiguities and uncertainties of the real world and that's great, but sometimes it is a real joy to read a story that ends with such magnificent closure. All mysteries are solved and everything makes sense. It is beautiful.(I have to admit that I was overjoyed when a group of my fifth period girls persistently voiced their disdain for Dickens' angel in the house Lucie and backed Madame Defarge. I think they may have created a Madame Defarge myspace, actually. Oh how the times have changed.)"Ms. R--, you got me." "What?" "At the beginning of this book, you said you would get some of us. And that we would love it. You got me." I didn't get you G--. Charles Dickens did. I just introduced you.Quote:"A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other."

	3.”It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.”It rarely happens that a quote from a book haunts me but this one, well, this one does. I finished “A Tale of Two Cities” about two weeks ago, yet I’m still not over the ending. But how could I? After all, this is one of those rare books that keep you thinking even after you finished the last page and already closed the cover of the book. The most intriguing thing about this all is the following though: I had a really, really tough time getting into “A Tale of Two Cities” when I first started to read it. XD The sentences were too long and complicated and Dickens writing style is lengthy and so full of superfluous words that every editor, no matter the century she/he lives in, would have had a field day crossing them out. *lol* ”O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a happy father’s face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!”So what happened? I can’t explain it, but I think Dickens’s magic happened. At least that’s the only thing I can come up with while I’m trying to explain my sudden love for this book. I mean we have a little bit of comedy in here when three different suitors attempt to ask for Lucy Manettes hand, yet at the same time Doctor Manette’s mental condition is making the situation as serious as it could possibly be. ”What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been more desirious in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine, if I knew how.”Every character in here is either an angel (Miss Manette) or a precious snowflake (Mr. Lorry & Charles Darnay) or it’s bloodthirsty and evil. (Madame Defarge & The Marquis) There is no grey area, well not unless you count Sydney Carton who is by far the most intriguing character in the entire book! I loved him! <3 Yes, he might have been a drunkard (and I’m pretty sure he suffered from depression) but of all the characters that made an appearance in “A Tale of Two Cities” he’s certainly the most honourable and pure soul! ”It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall sink lower, and be worse.”And this, Ladies and Gentleman, is the true tragedy of this book! That Sydney thinks he’s worth nothing even though he DESERVES THE FREAKING WORLD!!!! Excuse my screaming but ADKFASKDFKASDFKSDFKASD! I get all emotional just thinking about this lovable man! He is worthy, he is wantable, to hell with it, I’m actually going to compare him to my precious boy Adam Parrish now! *LOL* Both of them deserve so much and they are always trying to fit in, to make their life better, yet there’s always something that holds them back. That makes their lives difficult. ”You are a good man and a true friend,” said Carton, in an altered voice. “Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune, however.”No one notices the struggle he’s going through and a lot of people judge him for his actions. Not outright into his face but behind his back. Truth be told, I think Miss Manette might have been the only person who ever got a decent glimpse at his true character and nature. And this only because he let her see it! Because he loved her and because he wanted her to know that there was a part of him, the part that loved her, that actually was worthy of her love as well. T_T”I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding.” But we’re in the time of the guillotine, the time of change, of liberté, égalité et fraternité! And forgiveness and compassion, let alone justice aren’t truly on the agenda. People like the Marquis had no mercy with their subjects and their former servants pay them back in kind. Unfortunately this also means that innocent people, regardless of their actions and their lack of involvement are sentenced to death as well. Casualties in a war that gained momentum way too fast. And so it happens that the storyline swells to a crescendo that ends in a climax I didn’t expect! Boy, did that ending throw me! O_oIt was a beautiful ending, tragic, but beautiful, hopeful and sad. And it taught me that Dickens was indeed a great writer. ;-)(view spoiler)[”Are you dying for him?” she whispered.“And his wife and child. Hush! Yes.”“O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?”“Hush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last.”I cried an ocean reading this scene!!! Sydney Carton deserved so much better than that!!! What a noble and gentle and compassionate soul!! What a brave man that gives comfort while he’s going to his death as well!!! I can’t even!!! T_T I just can’t… *cries and ocean again* (hide spoiler)]Conclusion:I really loved this book! Dickens might write long sentences, he might take his time until everything gets into motion but damn, he certainly knows how to deliver a punch line! If you like classics and don’t mind books with a lengthy build-up you definitely should go for this! It was so worth it! XD”It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.”___________________3 Things: 1.) I’m finally doing this and I got myself some backup! XDThis book always kind of intimidated me but I think with the help of this awesome boy I’ll eventually manage to read it!Thank you so much for doing this buddy read with me! =))2.) Yesh!!! I can’t wait to know what Will and Tessa meant when they compared themselves to characters from “A Tale of Two Cities”!!! I’m sure my reread of “Clockwork Angel” later on this year will make so much more sense after reading this. *lol*3.) It’s Charles Dickens, 
AND
 it’s about time I finally read one of his books!!!

	1.My students (and some of my friends) can't ever figure out why I love this novel so much. I explain how the characters are thoroughly original and yet timeless, how the symbolism is rich and tasty, and how the narrative itself is juicy and chock-full of complexity, but they just shake their heads at me in utter amazement and say, "What's wrong with you, dude?"What's wrong, indeed.I give them ten or fifteen years. Perhaps they'll have to read it again in college, or maybe they'll just try reading it again as an adult to see if they can try to figure out why it's such a "classic," but after some time has passed from their initial encounter with the novel, they will find that I am not so crazy after all and that the book is in fact one of the best examples--if not the best example--of the novel. This happens to me all the time: I will re-read something I was forced to read in middle school and high school, remembering how much I hated it then, and will find that I actually love it now, as an adult. Sure, those "classics" may have taught me something about literary analysis, symbolic patterns, and the like, but I couldn't appreciate it for its complexity until I was older. I guess the rule of wine appreciation applies here, too: good taste only comes after much patience and experience.***Perhaps the thing I love best about this novel is the cast of characters--their names as well as their personalities. Ms. Havisham is one of my favorite characters to ever appear in all of the literature I have read. There is so much density and complexion to her character that I could literally make an entire career out of writing discourses on her characterization. She has even invaded the way I think about the world and the people I have met: I have, for instance, started referring to those instances where parents try to achieve success through their children "the Havisham effect" (unfortunately, you see this all too often in the world of teaching). Havisham's name is another exasperatingly fantastic aspect of her character: like the majority of Dickens' characters, you pretty much know what you're in for when you first read her name--she is full of lies, tricks, and deceits (or "sham"s). You don't get this sort of characterization much of anywhere else in the literary scene.Another reason I love this novel so much is its plotting. Remember, Dickens was writing in a serialized format so he needed to keep his readers hooked so that they'd want to buy the next issue of his periodical, All the Year Round, in order to see what happens next. Thus, the plot of Great Expectations is winding, unpredictable, and quite shocking at points. Certainly, in terms of heavy action--well, what our youngsters these days would call action, fighting and big explosions and what-not--there is none, or very little at most, but that's not the thing to be looking for. Figure out the characters first, and then, once you've gotten to know and even care for them (or hate them), you will be hooked on the plot because you will want to know what happens to these people who you've invested so much feeling into. This is, of course, true of all novels, but it's what I tell my students when they read Great Expectations for the first time, and by gum, it's helped more than a few of them get through the novel successfully.So, if you read Great Expectations in middle school, high school, or college, but haven't picked it up since, I urge you to do so. With a more patient and experienced set of eyes, you just might surprise yourself.

“There was a long hard time when I kept far from me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth.”

I first read Great Expectations when I was thirteen years old. It was the first of Dickens' works that I'd read of my own volition, the only other being Oliver Twist, which we'd studied parts of in school. You know, I missed out on a lot when I was thirteen. By this, I mean that I didn't always understand the deeper meaning lying beneath the surface of my favourite classics. I favoured fast-paced and gritty stories and didn't understand the love for Austen (later cured). But there was something about Great Expectations that hit me hard on all levels and there was a deeper understanding I took from it even back then.I should say first of all, this book makes me feel sad. Not a Lifetime movie emotionally overwrought pass-me-the-kleenex kind of sad. I have read it several times and have never once cried while reading it. But the book never fails to leave me with this hollow feeling that things could have been so different. When I was a kid, I often wished I could jump inside the TV and warn the good guys not to do something; stop something horrible from happening. This is that kind of book for me. All the not-knowing and mistaken assumptions that float between the characters in this novel is torture.Some readers don't like Dickens. He's been called "lacking in style", as well as a bunch of other things. Well, I think he's like the Stephen King of the Victorian era. He loves his drama, his characters are well-drawn but sometimes edging towards caricatures, he has a wonderful talent for painting a vivid picture of a scene in your mind but a bunch of his books are a hundred pages too long. Whatever. I love his stories. And I love his characters.In Great Expectations, you have the orphaned Philip "Pip" Pirrip who has spent his short life being poor and being bullied by his sister who is also his guardian. You have Joe Gargery, a kind man who also allows himself to be bullied by Pip's sister (his wife). Then you have the infamous Miss Havisham who was abandoned at the altar and now spends her days wandering around her mansion in her old wedding dress, hating men and raising the young Estella to be just like her.

“You are in every line I have ever read.”

At its heart, this is a book about someone who is given an opportunity to have all their dreams come true, to be better than they ever thought they could be, to be loved by someone who they never thought would look at them. We all yearn for something badly at times. Imagine having the chance to get exactly what you always wanted. Imagine becoming better and higher than you knew was possible. Imagine having all of that and then realizing that perhaps the most important thing you ever had got left behind.Pip was always my favourite Dickens protagonist because he wants so much and I sympathise with him. I can understand why he does what he does and why he wants what he wants. But the saddest thing is that ambition can make you lose sight of other important things and Pip has a lot of hard lessons to learn along the way. It's a book that was extremely relevant to the times when social class was of utmost importance in Britain. Essentially, the book deconstructs what it means to be a "gentlemen" and makes a not-so-subtle criticism of a class-based society.Who are the real gentlemen? The top hat wearing men of London with all their fine china and ceremony? Pip, who gets a chance to become one of them? Or Joe Gargery, the rough-talking blacksmith who even years later tells Pip: "you and me was ever friends"? There is a powerful lesson in here and I love it. Even after all these years.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram

      A Christmas Carol

	1.I read this every year at Christmas, and I always will do. Simply because of the atmosphere it evokes. This story is Christmas as far as I’m concerned. It wouldn’t be the same without it. It is perfectly festive and is also appropriately didactic. It is an allegory for what happens to those that are unnecessarily bitter and twisted, refusing to take part in a joyful occasion. It is a glimpse at what could happen to someone who rejects their family upon trivial grounds, and let’s themselves be set apart. It is also a suggestion that one shouldn’t be so concerned with money. Money isn’t everything; it certainly didn’t buy ol’ Scrooge happiness. But, Christmas did and will do so again.  ___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________

Dickens was already famous in 1843, but the sales of the recent installments of Martin Chuzzlewit were less than half of what he had received for the individual numbers of his previous novels. His publishers Chapman and Hall were so alarmed that they invoked a clause in Dickens contract which demanded that they be reimbursed for the printing cost of the Chuzzlewit installments. Dickens was alarmed too, but also hurt, offended...and worried. A large mortgage payment would soon be due, and his wife had just given birth to their fifth child. Still, he was convinced that his idea for a yuletide novella would yield an ample return and make up for the Chuzzlewit deficit. He financed the sumptuous edition of A Christmas Carol himself—colored plates, colored title page, gilt embossed front cover, gilt-edged pages, etc.—and insisted that the price not exceed the sum of 5 shillings (still expensive: one third of Cratchit’s weekly salary). Dickens waited eagerly for the money to roll in, but, although the sales were indeed phenomenal, Dickens gained little money from them. Although the cost of producing the elegant volume must have cut deeply into the profits, Dickens was convinced Chapman and Hall were cheating him and he refused to do business with them for the next fifteen years. But enough of money matters, for now! What follows are a few random observations on this, the latest of my many readings.1) How thoroughly Marley’s Ghost is surrounded by iron objects: doorknocker (large Victorian doorknockers were typically iron), iron door nails, iron coffin nails, iron chain and iron metal strong box. Helps us see what hard, unrelenting old sinners Marley and his partner really are.2) In addition to being hard of heart, Scrooge is a man with a deliberate philosophy of self-exoneration. It consists of two principles: 1) taxpayers fund the poor houses and prisons, thereby discharging in full their obligation to all of their fellow human beings, and 2) death by starvation, although it may seem regrettable, is actually a positive good as proven by science (because Malthus!), and relieves the rest of us of the burden of a surplus population. This philosophy is the shield that protects Scrooge from feeling the pains of sympathy and compassion.3) The first emotion produced in Scrooge by the Ghost of Christmas Past is sadness at this own boyhood loneliness, but the second emotion is his joy in the books that consoled him and helped him empathize with others: The Arabian Nights, the old romances (Valentine and Orson), and realistic fiction (Robinson Crusoe). In Ebenezer’s coming transformation, the sadness and its memory are of course necessary, but no more necessary than this joy.4) At Fezziwig’s Christmas party, the guest list is inclusive: the family and the clerks of course, but also the housemaid, the baker, the cook, the milkman, and a boy and a girl from down the street whom the Fezziwigs fear are mistreated by their masters and mistresses. Scrooge’s defense of his employer Fezziwig's little party which may only have cost “a few pounds” is even more eloquent than I remembered: 
He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count them up: what then? The happiness he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune."
 If I were dictator, I would compel our 21st century employers to listen to the above words at least four times a year. (Exception: employers who, in order to increase the volume of key strokes, forbid all family photographs and personal items in their data entry cubicles. No, those guys should have to listen to the above passage on a loop, eight hours a day, for the rest of their lives.)5) In my favorite movie version, the Alastair Sim Scrooge (1951), Ebenezer sees his former fiance as an old woman (still beautiful of course) nursing the sick and dying in the shadowy corners of the poorhouse. It is moving, certainly, but how much more effective—and crueler—is the Dicken’s original! There, Scrooge sees his former love happy in the recent past, a contented wife and mother surrounded by a whirlwind of children. 6) In the past I have viewed the temporal structure of the tale (ghost past, ghost present, ghost future) as an effective but obvious device. But the more I think about it, the more profound it seems, psychologically and spiritually. This, after all, is the pattern of every true conversion, the manner in which we grow in sympathy toward our fellow human beings: we reflect upon the emotionally charged sense impressions of the past, observe their consequences for good or ill manifested in the present, and then—on the basis of these observations—we make a decision to act in a new way, a way which draws us grow closer to love. Certainly St. Augustine would have understood, for it was how he envisioned the Trinity, as a model of love in action: memory, understanding, and will.Oh, speaking of how painful memories can inspire a person to action, I forgot to tell you the rest of the story about A Christmas Carol and money. Another factor that reduced Dickens' yuletide revenue stream was a cut-rate bit of plagiarism issued two weeks after Carol by Parley’s Illustrated Library called A Christmas Ghost Story. Parley's claimed they owed Dickens nothing because what they had published was not a piracy, but an "analytical condensation" of the tale, and, in addition, they had improved upon the original. (For example, in their version, Tiny Tim sings a song about a little child freezing in the snow.) Dickens sued and won, but Parley’s went bankrupt, and instead of gaining any money from his legal ordeal, Dickens was forced to pay 700 pounds in court costs.Now, here comes the good news: This painful experience so disillusioned Dickens with English civil law that he used it as his inspiration ten years later for what is arguably his finest, most mature creation, the masterpiece Bleak House. So I guess Dickens gained something from the experience after all.On that high note, I will leave you. And God bless us, everyone!

	1.Oliver Twist THE BOOK is crap and has NO songs in it, I couldn't believe it. So I googled and get this, it turns out they put those in the movie and Dickens had nothing to do with it! But since they were the best bit of the film, you can understand my horror and bereft sense of disappointment when I finally came to pick up the book. How could Dickens NOT have thought of having little Oliver sing Where Is Love when chucked into the cellar or Who Will Buy This Loverly Morning when he wakes up in his posh house...I mean yeah he was supposed to be good wasn't he? And please note the edition I read was not a Readers Digest Condensed Edition. When you DON'T have Fagin capering about warbling "In this life one thing counts/ In the bank, large amounts/I'm afraid these don't grow on trees/You got to pick a pocket or two" with that pederastic twinkle in his eyes as he surveys his small boys then alas I'm sorry to say that what you're left with is a bit of an antisemitic caricature lashed to a morality tale whose immoral moral appears to be that rich is good, poor is bad, and you better get yourself a deus ex machina in the form of a very unlikely sugardaddy to magic you out of the poorhouse or the rats will eat your bollocks, your bones will turn to dust and be blown away and no one will ever hire cute kids to pretend to be you on stage or screen and melt our hearts and win Oscars and Tonys. Which I think we all knew.

I looooooooved this book. Another Dickens...another favorite. 'Please, sir, I want some more.' Jane Austen and Charles Dickens have been dueling inside my WOW center for some time in a titanic, see-saw struggle for the title of greatest word-smither/story-crafter in all of English literature. Ms Austen previously caused heart-palpitations and a slew of gasms with Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility which left me spent like a cheap nickel. However, Sir Dickens, being a slick, wily devil responded in kind with A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations, a pair of wonderfully addictive, tingle causing joy blasts full of jaw-drops and breezy elegance. Where this battle of master word charmers will end….I could really care less because I’m sporting a complete happy going through their respective catalogs with a perma-smile on my face. Next up on the parade of mouth-watering, phrase turning feasts is The Adventures of Oliver Twist which is terrific on several levels. In relating the tragic (but ultimately rewarding) life of Oliver Twist, Dickens is at his most Austenesque as he employs with great effect biting sarcasm and dry, dark humor to scathingly satire the English Poor Laws of the 1830s. Of the novels I’ve read by Dickens, this is him at his most “socially conscious” and he strategically uses Oliver’s biography to harshly spotlight the greed, hypocrisy and let’s just say it…evil…of the society that organized and profited by the work house system of the middle 19th century. 
So they established the rule, that all poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody, not they,) of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it.
 We follow Oliver beginning with his difficult birth that killed his mother and almost cost the young lad his life as well. 
[T]here was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration- a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence…
 From there we journey with the child as he is dumped into a workhouse where his early life goes from bad to horrendously shitty as he’s subjected to a systematic process of neglect, physical brutality and starvation along with the other children residing there. Here is a passage from Chapter 2 that I think perfectly encapsulates the subtly sarcastic style Dickens employs to address his subject matter. 
The parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be ‘farmed,’ or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food, or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week. Sevenpence-halfpenny’s worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even shorter allowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher. Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rapacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four and twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air. Unfortunately for the experimental philosopher of the female to whose care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of her system; for at the very moment when a child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this. 
 I love the way Dickens can describe callous starvation and casual murder of children for nothing more than greed in such a way that I was actually chuckling because of his lusciously humorous phrasing. This man could write.Eventually, Oliver’s life takes another turn from horrendously shitty to mega-painful-chunks-of-misery-filled-crap when he has the temerity to utter the famous words,  “Please, sir, I want some more." He gets more…more beatings, more starvation,more verbal abuse,more neglect,…and ultimately finds himself alone on the streets with no means of survival. There, Oliver finds himself sucked into a life of petty criminality under the tutelage of “Fagin the Jew” who I thought was one of the most compelling Dickens characters ever.**[**Note: I know there is a lot of controversy about the portrayal of Fagin being one of the most egregious cases of anti-Semitism in classic literature. I think the criticism is fair, but I also don’t think (based on what I’ve read) that Dickens’ had any malicious intent. It is what it is and everyone can make their own decision on that point.] I thought the character of Fagin was fascinating and his signature phrase my dear (which he uses in almost every sentence) is still popping into my head more than a week after finishing the novel. Fagin, while irredeemably evil and in some ways a criminal caricature, Dickens draws him with such flair imbues him with a dimension and essence that I found very compelling. His psychology, his calculating intelligence and his soft words masking despicable actions is deftly laid out. At times, I almost got the impression that Fagin was intended to represent “the devil himself” with the way Dickens focuses on his corrupting influence. 
In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils; and, having prepared his mind by solitude and gloom to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it and change its hue for ever. 
 On one level, the life of Oliver Twist is one of the harshest, most depressingly sad tales ever put to paper. In lesser hands, the heartache and forlornness of Oliver’s birth and tragic early life could have swallowed up the story and made the book a real chore to get through. Good news…these are not lesser hands.Dickens writing is so melodic that the narrative glides over the horror at a safe middle-distance, allowing us to observe and absorb the surroundings without drowning in the pain that Dickens describes. I thought it was masterful. Intimate yet detached. Eventually, the plot takes a mysterious turn as a shadowy figure arrives on the scene who has a connection to Oliver and his past that is slowly revealed over the last half of the story. All of this leads to a marvelous ending that makes the rest of the story far more enjoyable in retrospect…sometimes positive, warm and fuzzy resolutions are exactly what a story needs. Dickens prose is buttery smooth while his mocking humor is cheddar sharp. His balance is outstanding and his ability to poke fun at his readers’ society while avoiding making the reader themselves feel like a target is brilliant. I had such a wonderful time reading this that I am left wondering why everyone doesn’t love Dickens as much as I do. 5.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!Okay, Ms. Austen…your turn again.

All of the characters were utterly divine, even the detestable Uriah Heep and the unbelievably pathetic Dora, and most especially the wonderful early Feminist icon that is Betsy Trotwood. I often have my doubts on first-person narrative, but Dickens is one of the few who can do it so well without losing many of the great advantages of reading with an omnipotent narrator. David Copperfield is unreliable in many fields-mostly his blind-spot for falling in love-but he is in-tune with his surroundings and can express what he feels other characters around him are feeling so suitably that it matters not that we are seeing the world through his young eyes only.The world was fantastic: I am always immediately transported to these places when I read 19th Century fiction and this was no exception. The strife of the poor and the decadence of the indifferent rich is interwoven here like smoke billowing in to pure oxygen. There were so many nooks and crannies to be explored that it took me a while to get through this nigh-on 900 page book, but it was worth it.Aside from one or two tangents which meant the story-line stalled ever so slightly, it flowed magnificently and I don't remember laughing so much at a book that wasn't a straight humour novel. Dickens has a way of writing with such endearment about his characters and society, but also tearing them apart at the same time. It was a beautiful ride through the English countryside and a nice run through the heavy streets of London and I don't think Thackeray was wrong when he said, "Bravo Dickens."Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy

	1.This is a very clever book because the main issue with it is exactly the point Dickens is making: it is so long and dragged out.Bleak House is quite the achievement. It's a 900+ page monster made up a thousand different subplots with a large cast of characters. It also fanned the flames that led to a huge overhaul of the legal system in England. Buried beneath and entwined with the many subplots is the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce - Dickens's parody of the Chancery Court system (because the case is dragged out over many years).I like Dickens, and I can appreciate what Bleak House does, but I'm sorry to say I won't be joining the ranks who consider this their favourite. His best work objectively? Maybe. Who even knows what that means? But definitely not my favourite. That would be Great Expectations-- a novel that just rips my heart out and stomps all over it.I really do understand that this is the whole point, but so many chapters and events in this book were extended needlessly, padded out with waffle and meanderings that seemed to have nothing to do with the novel at large. That's very clever and all - given that this is a critique of a court system that extends everything needlessly and gets nothing done - but it's a bit of a chore to read. It's a shorter book than Les Misérables, The Count of Monte Cristo and War and Peace, but it truly doesn't feel like it.The characters, too, were not as memorable as many of Dickens others. Having read it, I can now see why the Bleak House characters are not household names like Miss Havisham or Bill Sykes. I found them bland in comparison. I also think it was a mistake to have the simpering "I'm so modest and unintelligent" Esther Summerson as a narrator (Dickens's only female narrator). It's unfortunate because I think Dickens usually excels at first person narration, but Esther's constant need to reiterate her modesty and lack of intelligence is frustrating.If I were rating this book based on how well it achieved what it set out to do, it would be an easy five stars. If you believe classics are not there for enjoyment but for self-flagellation, this is an easy five stars. Dickens successfully wrote a long and slow book to show how the legal system is so long and slow. Some of the subplots and character dramas were interesting; many were not.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube

I've nearly read all of them so you may take my word. Have I ever written a review which was anything less than 101% reliable, honest and straightforward? Well, there you are then.Bleak House gives some people a leetle problem insofar as you have half of it narrated by Esther (Goody Three Shoes, too good for just two) Summerson, who you ache to have a few bad things happen to, because she trills, she sings, she sees the best in everyone, tra la la, tweedly dee dee. This does get on some people's nerves. But I downloaded a dvd called Dickens Girls Gone Wild last week and let me tell you there's a whole other side to Esther Summerson - given the right surroundings (I think it was Malta, and the sangria was flowing) she could be good company. However. Bleak House as a whole does no more than take it upon itself to explain how society works. And it's utterly gobsmacking. There are a lot of words in Bleak House's 890 pages but gobsmacking is not one of them. It's a word that was invented to describe Dickens novels.

	1.This collection of Christmas stories had three different stories including Dickens most celebrated Christmas story of all time, the Christmas Carol. All the stories are interesting but the Christmas carol is outstanding. The message it conveys always warm my heart. It is my favorite Christmas story to date. I believe Dickens subtle writing and his philosophical thinking is more expressed in his Christmas stories. For this reason, these stories have always held readers attention. And for my part, I really did enjoy them.

      Little Dorrit

  3.99
reviews:
	1.Little Dorrit is Charles Dickens’s eleventh novel, published in monthly parts between December 1855 and June 1857, and illustrated by his favourite artist and friend Hablot Knight Browne, or “Phiz”. We tend to give Dickens’s novels convenient labels, such as the one criticising the workhouse: “Oliver Twist”, the one criticising schools: “Nicholas Nickleby”, the one criticising the legal system: “Bleak House”, and the one criticising unions: “Hard Times”. This one could be thought of as “the one criticising government bureaucracy”. But it is much, much more than that. By now Dickens had established himself as a literary phenomenon. He was an enormously popular novelist, but he was keen to sustain his literary status as well as entertain the crowds. Like “Bleak House”, this is an elaborate, very complex and occasionally creaky novel with many interwoven and seemingly inexplicable mysteries. In this, it seems more of a natural successor to “Bleak House”, rather than to the much shorter and more direct one which preceded it, “Hard Times” (although the vitriol of “Hard Times” is in evidence here too). Although Little Dorrit is set in about 1826, it was written only a few years after the great Crystal Palace Exhibition “of the Works of Industry of All Nations” in 1851. It is interesting to wonder whether this vicious attack on British institutions is in part a commentary by Dickens on Britain’s grand industrial and social advances. Dickens was continuing to work at a frenetic pace — to “burn himself out” in the modern vernacular — and his personal life was equally frenzied. In these two years, he bought two new houses, including his dream house “Gads Hill” in Rochester, which he had admired since he was a boy. He lived in Folkestone, Paris, Boulogne and London, as well as travelling for speeches and business. He continued to write, edit, and give public readings, be involved in the lives of his children, and was as enthusiastic about the theatre as ever. He produced and acted in 6 plays and farces during this time, helped by his friend Wilkie Collins, although Dickens was very much the driving force behind them. And his letters reveal that he was approaching a domestic crisis, and increasingly frustrated with his marriage. He was preoccupied by the idea of freedom in all areas; freedom assumed a greater and greater importance to him, and he was increasingly impatient with the Victorian constraints of his time.Little Dorrit is the novel which comes out of this state of mind. The themes of prisons and being trapped in various ways, both physically and psychologically, permeate throughout the book. Dickens certainly felt himself trapped, whatever others thought. He also felt a long-buried shame at his father’s incarceration in the “Marshalsea” Prison for debt. This is perhaps the novel most influenced by Charles Dickens’s early experience, and a sense of gross injustice prevails too. In fact the original title of the novel, for the first four issues, was not Little Dorrit but “Nobody’s Fault”. The Marshalsea Prison was a notorious prison in Southwark, Surrey (although Southwark is now part of London), just south of the River Thames. It was one of London’s best known debtors’ prisons, and one with which Dickens was well acquainted. Of course, the irony was that the only way for those incarcerated to survive there, was by purchasing items to keep themselves fed and clothed. Getting out was well nigh impossible, as being incarcerated, they could rarely earn any money! It was very much like a village behind bars, and although it was 30 years since his father had been imprisoned there (and the prison had been closed down in 1842), Dickens had never returned to look at it. Only when he came to write Little Dorrit, did Dickens nerve himself to visit the parts of it which were still standing. He notes in his preface, that this was in order to research the “rooms that arose to my mind’s eye when I became Little Dorrit’s biographer.” Yet Amy Dorrit (“Little Dorrit”) is not the main character in the book. If there is just one, it would be Arthur Clennam. Dickens may well have decided to name his novel after Amy, since she is one of the very few virtuous unaffected characters, always seeking opportunities for each of her family, and through sheer determination, working towards the best life they can all have. She may be small in stature, but her heart and courage are great indeed. Amy was born in the “Marshalsea” Prison, surrounded by a family who all display the faults which can result from such a meanness of environment. Her father, William, is so pompous, so quick to take offence, and so socially conscious, that having the unofficial title “Father of the Marshalsea” conferred on him, is seen by him as a great honour. He is arrogant, selfish, and “all show”, continually bolstered up by Amy’s coquettish and patronising sister Fanny, a theatrical dancer, and her brother Tip, a roguish ne’er-do-well. William’s brother Frederick, a broken man, has been up to now, Amy’s only true friend.We also follow the story of Arthur Clennam. On his father’s death, Arthur has returned from business abroad, and is at a loose end. Arthur’s mother is a grim, old puritanical woman, who is paralysed, and living in the gloomy, decrepit old family house. She is attended by Flintwinch, a malicious man, twisted in both body and mind, who has wheedled himself into being her business partner, and forced the family servant, Affery, to marry him. These three form a unholy trio. The scenes set here have a gothic unearthly quality, and Affery, with her terrified nonsensical babbling, comes across as some kind of wise seer. There is hatred and malevolence here; a deep-seated resentment, but we are not privy to its cause, and neither is Arthur.There are myriad minor characters who make this novel sparkle, although it is a sinister sparkle, perhaps as in sparkly vampires. There is the avaricious Casby, with his flowing white hair and twinkly eyes, with a semblance of benevolence shining out of his bald head. There is his whipping-boy and rent-collector Pancks, a little chugging steam engine, busily screwing more and more money out of Casby’s tenants. There is Casby’s daughter, the widow Flora Finching, fat, flirtatious and foolish. Twittery, chattery Flora used to be Arthur’s sweetheart (a fact which now appalls him) and is determined that he will never forget that fact, much to Arthur’s embarrassment and chagrin. She now looks after an equally eccentic and hilariously impossible relative, “Mr F.’s aunt”. Flora’s character is based on Maria Beadnell (later Mrs Henry Winter), with whom Charles Dickens had fallen madly in love, in 1830, when he was 18. Maria, like Flora, was pretty and flirtatious, and the daughter of a highly successful banker (similar enough to a property-owner). After three years, her parents objected to the relationship, because Dickens’s prospects did not look good. Dickens wrote to her, “I never have loved and I never can love any human creature breathing but yourself.” And it is clear from his letters to his friend, John Forster, that Dickens had felt completely heartbroken over the break-up.He met Maria, now Mrs Winter, again in 1856, and although he knew she was a great fan of her work, he was devastated at how she had changed, although she had tried to warn him, describing herself candidly in a letter as being “toothless, fat, old and ugly”. Dickens found her talkativeness especially irritating, and quickly attempted to extricate himself from all but the most essential social contact with her — and always strictly in public. Dickens it now was, who rebuffed Maria’s flirtatious attempts, and he portrayed her here as the voluble and irrepressible Flora.Perhaps an old affection did temper his pen, however. Although it seems a cruel, heartless portrait initially, Flora reveals herself to have a heart of gold, and hidden perceptiveness, as the novel proceeds. These characters who are so vociferous often prove to be the most multi-layered in Dickens’s novels. The silent ones are often more shadowy. But Flora is an appalling delight, and some scenes which feature her may well make you laugh out loud:“Wanting the heart to explain that this was not at all what he meant, Arthur extended his supporting arm round Flora’s figure. ‘Oh my goodness me,’ said she. ‘You are very obedient indeed really and it’s extremely honourable and gentlemanly in you I am sure but still at the same time if you would like to be a little tighter than that I shouldn’t consider it intruding’”.There is Mr Merdle, the financier and greatest man of his time: “As a vast fire will fill the air to a great distance with its roar, so the sacred flame which the mighty Barnacles had fanned caused the air to resound more and more with the name of Merdle. It was deposited on every lip, and carried into every ear. There never was, there never had been, there never again should be, such a man as Mr Merdle. Nobody, as aforesaid, knew what he had done; but everybody knew him to be the greatest that had appeared.”Dickens builds Mr Merdle up so much that we are tempted to suspect that everything might come crashing down! In fact Mr Merdle is based on a real life Irish financier and politician, called John Sadleir, (view spoiler)[a “prince of swindlers”. John Sadleir had resigned his ministerial position, when he was found guilty of being implicated in a plot to imprison a depositor of the Tipperary Bank, because the individual in question had refused to vote for him. His disastrous speculations and forgeries had ruined several major banks, to the tune of more than £1.5 million. John Sadleir had ended his life by drinking prussic acid. (hide spoiler)] There is Mr Merdle’s wife, always referred to as “the Bosom”, on which he displays all his jewels and worldly acquisitions. Mrs Merdle piques herself on being society, hypocritically professing herself “charmed” at the idea of being a “perfect savage”. She values her own status, money and etiquette above all else. There is her son from a previous marriage, Edward Sparkler, a chap of limited intelligence, whose highest praise of a woman is that there is “no nonsense about her”. There is young John Chivery, the prison warden’s son, who is devoted to Amy, and has a tendency to keep imagining his own gravestone with appropriate new inscriptions, according to how he feels the wind is blowing with respect to her feelings about him. And the kindly Meagles family: the retired banker Mr Meagles, impossibly convinced that all the world should speak English, his wife, and their cossetted daughter Minnie, or “Pet”. There is Pet’s companion or servant “Tattycoram”, whose real name is Harriet Beadle. Tattycoram/Harriet is an interesting character, who is to play an essential part in the novel’s outcome. She grows greatly in character, but initially has understandable feelings of resentment. She was a foundling, who has ostensibly been adopted by the Meagles. They think they are being benevolent in this, but in fact she feels patronised, instructed to “count five and twenty, Tattycoram” whenever she shows her temper, and is treated more like a servant than a companion. These feelings are encouraged by another malevolent and manipulative presence in the book, Miss Wade, one of Dickens’s most evil creations.We have a veritable panoply of characters then, full of energy and life, spilling from the pages, as always in a novel by Dickens — and there are many more I have not mentioned. And the dastardly villain of the piece? He is a true pantomime villain — “Rigaud”, alias “Blandois” — based on the hated tyrant Napoleon III — and we first meet him right at the start of the novel, in a prison, in Marseilles. For this novel does not start out in the dank gloom of the Marshalsea, but in an oppressive hellhole of a prison in the blistering heat of the South of France. We see Rigaud’s arrogant, evil, manipulative, swaggering personality straightaway, and although Dickens keeps up the mystery by rarely naming him, we can recognise him every time he enters the stage, by his malicious, devilish smile, when: “his moustache went up under his nose, and his nose came down over his moustache”.Mysteries abound in this novel. There are long-lost twins, both male and female, impersonations and doppelgängers, unsuspected marriages and dysfunctional relationships. There is truth, but mostly there are lies, and secrets. There is the collapse of an institution, both metaphorically and in a very dramatic literal scene. It is doom-laden, with delusions and dreams; mysterious creaking sounds are seen to be prophetic. There is a suicide — and a murder — and animal cruelty. It is a novel of two parts, entitled “Poverty” and “Riches”. In the second part, there is restitution of a sort, and there is punishment. Debts are paid. Poverty is transformed into riches, and those who were kind to each other when they were poor, become more spiteful or selfish, considering such earlier behaviour to be humiliating. Starting in Marseilles, the action removes to London and then Venice — a crumbling, decaying edifice, reflected in the degeneration of the characters within it. In Little Dorrit any prosperity is almost a guarantee that the wealth will be put to bad use. Even that decidedly decent fellow Daniel Doyce, intelligent and kind, the inventor of an unspecified mechanical wonder, is unable to get a patent for it in the Circumlocution Office, and we fear for his future. Nothing in Little Dorrit is what it appears to be. In many ways it is as much of a mystery story as “Bleak House”. Almost all the characters are self-seeking, and the message of the novel is a very bleak one indeed. For whereas the concerns of the novel are similar to those of “Dombey and Son”, in Little Dorrit it is not only business concerns which are corrupt. It has a far wider purview — Dickens here attacks the whole of British society. The novel Little Dorrit does not merely indicate a dark view of human nature, but is a savage indictment of the corruption at the heart of British institutions, and the effects of British economic and social structure upon every single individual. Dickens shows with this embittered novel that he believes British society to be rotten to the core, and riddled with deceit. There are only two refuges from the all-pervasive “Circumlocution Office”, either exile, or prison. The very name “Circumlocution Office” is a challenge, and with the monstrous “Barnacle” family, Dickens once more thumbs his nose, by naming the family after a limpet-like marine animal, which lies on its back and attaches itself to anything solid, such as a ship forging ahead and destroying everything in its path. This is another metaphor for that great destroyer of originality, the Circumlocution office. It is a self-serving system of sinecures; a place where all the employees learn “how not to do it”, where all innovation, creativity, individualism and enterprise are efficiently stifled and ultimately quashed. Together with the Stiltstalkings, the Barnacles infest both government and society, going around in circles, spewing red tape, and accomplishing nothing. They ensure that no business which might promote the common good is ever done, crushing both originality and initiative, and rendering all relationships false. This damning satiric representation of the Civil Service draws on Dickens’s view of the recent government’s bad decisions during the Crimean War (which they expected would take 12 weeks, but in fact took twelve months, three major land battles and countless actions resulting in loss of life on a massive scale) coupled with the leftover cynicism from his own days as a young parliamentary reporter. Dickens was well placed to comment on the Civil Service, and his view was savage, waspish — and also very witty. Chapter 10: “Containing the Whole Science of Government” is possibly the funniest thing Dickens ever wrote — and that’s really saying something!The extraordinary achievement of Little Dorrit is that such a devastating and dour indictment of British society and institutions can be so very readable, so topical, yet at the same time so current, in its description of the never-ending wheels grinding on in the Civil Service — and to contain such delightful characters. Dickens’s characters can be recognised in any age; he knew how to write about the familiar types of people we all know. I can see Mrs Merdle with her “Bird, be quiet!”, and the awful spectacle of Mr Dorrit with his airs and graces, posturing, hemming and hawing “hem — hah — ah”. I can see the heart-rending picture of an over-large child, Maggy, Amy’s mentally disabled friend with her “large features, large feet and hands, large eyes and no hair”, devotedly following her diminutive friend Amy round like a little dog, with an inner conviction that if they all go to “’orspital” everything will be all right. I can see timid beaten Affery, worrying about “those two clever ones” always plotting. I can see the appalling “varnishing” of the smooth-tongued Mrs General, employed as a tutor to Fanny and Amy, with her insistence on reciting “Papa, potatoes, poultry, prunes and prism” at every opportunity, in order to keep the lips in the desired pouting positions: “[her] way of forming a mind was to prevent it from forming opinions. She had a little circular set of mental grooves or rails on which she started little trains of other people’s opinions, which never overtook one another, and never got anywhere”. And now I can see the final scene in the book open up before my eyes. The two characters we have been rooting for most, come out of the church of St George the Martyr, in Southwark, and are swallowed up in the roar of the city:“[they pause] for a moment on the steps of the portico looking at the fresh perspective of the street in the autumn morning sun’s bright rays, and then went down. Went down into a modest life of usefulness and happiness ... into the roaring streets, inseparable and blessed.”Curiously enough, in the church of St George the Martyr now, Little Dorrit herself is still to be seen. If you approach the altar and look up at the left panel of the magnificent stained glass window behind it, you will see the figure of St George, see that his foot is resting on a piece of parchment. Directly beneath this is a much smaller, kneeling figure of a girl, whose hands are clasped in prayer, and whose poke-bonnet is dangling from her back. This is “Little Dorrit”:Dickens always provides us with neatly tied up endings, in which mostly the evil characters get their just deserts, and our heroes achieve some sort of happiness, or growth. We have that here, but we also have a deep sense of doom, or foreboding. Their destinies lie heavily shrouded in the ether; the fug of the city.George Bernard Shaw considered Little Dorrit to be Dickens’s “masterpiece among many masterpieces”. I cannot think of a more apt description.

‘’He told me, coming home, that he hopes the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk and blind men see.’’
My most cherished copy of A Christmas Carol is an illustrated Greek children's book that dates back to 1993. A gift by my grandmother who had a vicious love for all things ghostly and supernatural, it was the story that prompted my fascination with spirits and festive terrifying stories. The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come still gives me goosebumps. For generations and generations raised with this book as the essence of Christmas, Scrooge and his haunting adventure is the personification of the true meaning of Christmas.
''Humbug!''
As Scrooge goes on a journey through time under the guidance of the three spirits, the readers may be challenged to look back on their own very real adventures. The memories of Christmas Past, past joys, hopes, regrets, and mistakes. Present reasons to be happy, present troubles that demand a solution. And what of the life that is yet to come? Well, the future is a dark hole, faceless and voiceless and waiting to come to fruition through a dynamic combination of Lady Luck's whims and our own actions. But if we are to believe our troubled protagonist, hope is always there.Tons and tons of ink have been spilled for Dickens's masterpiece. For me, it is the characters that make this novel an everlasting, trusted friend. We all have a happy, carefree, open-minded relative or friend like Scrooge's nephew or Mr. Fezziwig. We can find an anchor to prevent ourselves from falling into despair in the example of the Cratchit family and Tiny Tim's resilience. And let us face it. We all carry an ounce (or more...) of Scrooge in us.This beautiful volume also contains beautiful musings on Christmas Festivities, the deliciously disturbing The Story of the Goblins Who Stole A Sexton, a Christmas episode from Master Humphrey's Clock, The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain, a tale of a troubled professor and the spirit of the holidays, the autobiographical A Christmas Tree, the thought-provoking The Seven Poor Travellers, a handy Dickens Chronology, informative Appendixes, an excellent Introduction by Michael Slater and decorated with illustrations by Arthur Rackham and John Leech .And it would be useful if fanatics on both sides bothered to pay attention to the following extract...
''There are some upon the earth of yours'', returned the Spirit, ''who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.''

But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round…as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And there, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!”-	Nephew Fred in Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol As near as I can tell, A Christmas Carol is perfect. It embodies, in a very real way, Christmas itself. Charles Dickens is justly famous for his big, sprawling, shaggy-dog serials, in which he spun intricate and twisty tales with the loquaciousness of a man being paid by the word. They are filled with dozens of characters, all of them lovingly observed, most with a laundry list of quirks. They are filled with ups and downs and more ups and more downs. They are seemingly designed to avoid reaching any sort of conclusion. Indeed, many of his epics, such as Bleak House and Great Expectations, have an ad hoc feel to them, as though Dickens himself was as uncertain of his ending as the reader. Not so with A Christmas Carol. A Christmas Carol is short, efficient, and tightly focused. It has a natural symmetry and a wonderful simplicity, with just a handful of characters and an all-time killer hook: greedy old miser Ebenezer Scrooge is visited, upon Christmas Eve, by four apparitions (Jacob Marley and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come) who teach him a powerful lesson about the meaning of the day. This is a book with a message, a thesis statement, yet it entertains while it preaches. The visit from his long-deceased partner Jacob Marley (“dead these seven years”), sets out the parameters of the story: that three other ghosts will visit Scrooge to teach him the meaning of Christmas, and by extension, how to live a better life all the year long. The first meeting of man and ghost, a seriocomic scene set in Scrooge’s bedchambers, is classic Dickens, and manages to balance pedantry with humor (by way of some un-improvable dialogue).Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before; he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses. “How now!” said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever. “What do you want with me?”“Much!” – Marley’s voice, no doubt about it.“Who are you?”“Ask me who I was.” “Who were you then?” said Scrooge, raising his voice. “You’re particular, for a shade.”After Jacob’s departure, Scrooge repairs to his bed, to await the other ghosts. First is the Ghost of Christmas Past (“Long past?” “Your past”),who transports Scrooge to his childhood, where we learn of Scrooge’s strained relationship with his father, his close relationship with his sister, and the lost love of his life, a woman named Belle, who Scrooge forsook for money. The scenes with the Ghost of Christmas Past have always been my favorite, because they toy with the very foundations upon which Christmas is built: a slightly melancholic nostalgia for the way things were, or how we remembered them to be. In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke. In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the baker. In came the cook, with her brother’s particular friend, the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress. In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, anyhow and everyhow…Next, the Ghost of Christmas Present arrives. He presents as a jolly man, but the longer we spend time with him – meeting Scrooge’s clerk, Bob Cratchit, and his crippled son, Tiny Tim; looking in on the Christmas party of Scrooge’s nephew, Fred – the more of a dark pedagogue he becomes. By the time Christmas Present takes his leave, he is lecturing us about Ignorance, Want, and Doom (in many ways, he is the drunk uncle we all know and tolerate). Finally, there is the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, who shows Scrooge the misery and death that awaits if he does not change his ways. The silent specter is an oppressive presence, and represents Dickens at his most on-the-nose, banging away at his points with a hammer. Yet, it all sets up exquisitely for a rousing finale. A Christmas Carol has been adapted hundreds of times. Thousands, if you count local theaters. It is a testament to Dickens’ creation that most of these adaptations hew so closely to the original. There is no need to add, subtract, or tinker. (On the subject of adaptations, if you ever see me at a Christmas party, I will be happy to explain my theory on how every Christmas movie springs from A Christmas Carol). This particular volume also includes other Christmas stories and writings by Dickens. Frankly, they barely rate a mention, at least relative to A Christmas Carol. It is hard to be interested in these minor offerings when compared to the alpha dog of all Christmas literary offerings. It’s a bit like having your Bugatti test drive interrupted by some dude who wants you to try his skateboard.  In the spirit of charity, I suppose there is some merit in studying these other stories, if only to compare and contrast them to A Christmas Carol. For instance, in The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton, you see many of the elements (a Christmas humbug, ghosts) that Dickens would later use to better effect. In The Haunted Man and the Ghost’s Bargain, written post-Carol, Dickens introduces another pedagogic specter. This ghost allows a man named Redlaw to lose all memories of his sufferings and sorrows, with generally bad consequences. This story blatantly attempts to capitalize on the popularity of A Christmas Carol – complete with a lesson! – and unfortunately indulges in Dickens’ weakness for overly-wacky characters. Dickens has been called “the man who invented Christmas.” Obviously, that is not literally true. And it is not really figuratively true, either. Dickens was, in fact, building on traditions that far predated his classic fable. His bit of genius was to take this holiday and give it transformative power. Not only a day of celebration, but a day of contemplation. Not just a time to think about mulled wine and plum pudding, but to ponder those who are poor, sick, or struggling. “Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents,” Jo grumbles at the start of Little Women, twenty-six years after the publication of A Christmas Carol. Such is the current state of Christmas. Those Cratchit kids, though, would never think such a thing. They’d never dare utter such a complaint; even the smallest goose was enough to satisfy them. The values espoused in A Christmas Carol are timeless and meaningful. But it is more than a parable. More than any other book or movie or song or play, A Christmas Carol draws us intimately into the best parts of this yearly celebration. That is why I have never tired of the story, no matter how many times and in how many ways I have experienced it. I love A Christmas Carol, whether it is in Muppet form, or Magoo form, or George C. Scott form, or Patrick Stewart form, or the original novella, which I read every year. In Scrooge’s rebirth, marked by a turkey as big as a child, and the promise of parties featuring a bowl of smoking bishop and Blind Man’s Bluff, we are given a version of an idealized Christmas: the table is full, family is present, and the children are healthy. In presenting this idealized Christmas, Dickens manages to capture the importance of memory. When you were young, time started to slow in December, and then stopped completely during that hour-long church service standing between you and your gift-wrapped toys. As you get older, Christmas comes and goes much quicker, and leaves you weighing this year’s festivities (often unfavorably) to all that came before. Years pass, and the composition of your family changes through addition and subtraction, through birth and death. Coming as it does so near the end of the year, Christmas becomes a transitory signpost. Our Christmas traditions, though, push back against mortality, and place us instead along a continuum. Sure, maybe Grandma is gone, but her ornaments are still on the tree, glittering like they have since World War II. Tradition keeps her alive, and will keep us alive when we are gone. Dickens used Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come to change Scrooge. Those are also the very elements that we require in our own celebrations: the memories of the past; our friends and family (and some wine) in the present; and the knowledge in the future that this will always exist, even if we are not there to enjoy it.

	1.This book is, for me, Dickens' best. I loved every second of it, the darkness of Tom's steady descent into drinking and gambling were brilliant and there were several times I found myself simply rereading a few paragraphs over and over, in awe at them. (The end of Chapter XIX, The Whelp, is something I hold in very high regard as possibly one of his best pieces of writing ever.) I want to deal with the characters individually from here, since I feel they are all very important.Mr Gradgrind - Facts. This man's obsession with facts and hate for fantasy is possibly one of the most genius parts of the plot, highlighting exactly what Dickens means to say. His regret at the end serves to show the inevitable outcome of living his sort of life, and is done in a very clever way. His name is also wonderful. I like to say it. Gradgrind. It's great, isn't it?Bounderby - Dickens made me hate him, and he was made to be hated. For all his bluster and superiority he is in fact worse in moral integrity than Stephen or Tom, which is why I was intensely glad as Louisa took her steps away from him. He really is a 'bounder'.Louisa/Loo - A perfect tragic heroine, but I couldn't help thinking more than once that she should really get some backbone. But I suppose that was the point, so she was well done too.Cecilia/Sissy - I didn't like her very much, but I did like the way she was used, as the embodiment of fancy and fun. She served to drive the point home and was useful in terms of story development.Tom/The Whelp - Goodness, I hated him sometimes. As I've already said, his descent was done well and some of the description around him was fantastic. Dickens' habit of referring to him as the whelp was perfect.Stephen Blackpool - The character I could emphathise with most, he was likeable and pitiable. I loved his struggle with Slackbridge and the Trade Union, and his contrasting relationships with Rachel and his wife made me feel very sorry for both of them. His ending was also very sad, and shows just how cruel people can be to each other.Mrs Sparsit - One of the most brilliant in the book. The image of her staircase, with Louisa walking to the bottom, is one that has stuck with me as being particularly genius. I also laughed at her disappointment by the train towards the end, as she was so anxious to see the downfall of others she ended up being nothing more than a jobless window.James Harthouse - Although for most of the book I wished Louisa would run away with him, the end convinced me otherwise. Still, he was a very interesting character who provided a catalyst for all the suppressed emotions of the Gradgrinds/Bounderbys.All in all, a brilliant book.
	2.The novel depends on the opposition between fact, Dickens's name for the cold and loveless attitude to the life he associated with Utilitarianism, and fancy, which represents all the warmth of the imagination. A contrast which gives it both tension and unity.

	1.The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, Charles DickensThe novel centers on the life and adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, a young man who must support his mother and sister after his father dies. Nicholas Nickleby's father dies unexpectedly after losing all of his money in a poor investment. Nicholas, his mother and his younger sister, Kate, are forced to give up their comfortable lifestyle in Devonshire and travel to London to seek the aid of their only relative, Nicholas's uncle, Ralph Nickleby. Ralph, a cold and ruthless businessman, has no desire to help his destitute relations and hates Nicholas, who reminds him of his dead brother, on sight. He gets Nicholas a low-paying job as an assistant to Wackford Squeers, who runs the school Dotheboys Hall in Yorkshire. Nicholas is initially wary of Squeers (a very unpleasant man with one eye) because he is gruff and violent towards his young charges, but he tries to quell his suspicions. As Nicholas boards the stagecoach for Greta Bridge, he is handed a letter by Ralph's clerk, Newman Noggs. A once-wealthy businessman, Noggs lost his fortune, became a drunk, and had no other recourse but to seek employment with Ralph, whom he loathes. The letter expresses concern for him as an innocent young man, and offers assistance if Nicholas ever requires it. Once he arrives in Yorkshire, Nicholas comes to realise that Squeers is running a scam: he takes in unwanted children (most of whom are illegitimate, crippled or deformed) for a high fee, and starves and mistreats them while using the money sent by their parents, who only want to get them out of their way, to pad his own pockets. Squeers and his monstrous wife whip and beat the children regularly, while spoiling their own son. Lessons are no better; they show how poorly educated Squeers himself is and he uses the lessons as excuses to send the boys off on chores. While he is there, Nicholas befriends a simple boy named Smike, who is older than the other "students" and now acts as an unpaid servant. Nicholas attracts the attention of Fanny Squeers, his employer's plain and shrewish daughter, who deludes herself into thinking that Nicholas is in love with her. She attempts to disclose her affections during a game of cards, but Nicholas doesn't catch her meaning. Instead he ends up flirting with her friend Tilda Price, to the consternation of both Fanny and Tilda's friendly but crude-mannered fiancé John Browdie. After being accosted by Fanny again, Nicholas bluntly tells her he does not return her affections and wishes to be free of the horrible atmosphere of Dotheboys Hall, earning her enmity. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز پانزدهم ماه ژوئن سال 2010میلادیعنوان: نیکلاس نیکلبی متن کوتاه شده؛ نویسنده: چارلز دیکنز؛ مترجم: محسن سلیمانی؛ تهران، انتشارات سوره، 1376، در 116ص، شابک ایکس 964471301؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان انگلیسی - سده 19منشر افق، 1388، در 137 ص؛ شابک 9789643695255؛عنوان: نیکلاس نیکلبی؛ نویسنده: چارلز دیکنز؛ مترجم: بهرام آریان؛ مریم سلمانی زاده؛ تهران حامدین، 1380، در 139ص، شابک 9649301011؛ موضوع: داستانهای بریتانیایینیکولاس جوان، و خانواده اش از یک زندگی با آرامش لذت میبرند، تا اینکه پدرش از دنیا میرود، و آنها را بی پول و تنها میگذارد؛ «نیکولاس» به همراه خواهر و مادرش، به «لندن» میروند، تا از عمویش «رالف»، درخواست یاری کنند؛ اما «رالف» قصد دارد خانواده را از هم جدا کرده، و از آنها سوء استفاده کند؛ «نیکولاس» به مدرسه ای که توسط مردی بیرحم اداره میشود، فرستاده میشود و...؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 26/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی

	3.Peter Ackroyd, in his ground-breaking biography of Charles Dickens, says that Nicholas Nickleby is "perhaps the funniest novel in the English language". The complete title of the novel is perhaps a bit of a mouthful,"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, containing a Faithful Account of the Fortunes, Misfortunes, Uprisings, Downfallings and Complete Career of the Nickleby Family".It was published, as his previous novels had been, in monthly installments, between 1838 and 1839, and the last part was again a double issue. Whilst Dickens was writing this he was between 26 and 27 years of age, and also putting the final touches to his enormously successful "Oliver Twist". Some of the plot elements, and Dickens's social criticisms, are very much in the vein of "Oliver Twist". Yet in many ways the novel is more similar to his first installment novel, "The Pickwick Papers". It has a comic rather than a tragic feel, and is certainly more lightweight and humorous than "Oliver Twist". It could be classed as ironic social satire, pointing up social injustices, while full of Dickens's taste for absurdity.The picaresque style of "The Pickwick Papers" recalls very much the earlier 18th century fashion for vignettes, such as those written by Henry Fielding. Although Nicholas Nickleby is held together by a continuing saga, it is still very episodic; subject to shifts in focus, and with such a wealth of characters and subplots that the main thrust of the novel occasionally seems to be lost. However, this episodic feel was still a very popular style of the time. When it was published the book was an immediate success, further establishing Dickens's reputation. Indeed, an engraving of one of the most famous portraits of Dickens, is used as the frontispiece, and is called "the Nickleby Portrait". Charles Dickens sat for this portrait in June 1839, partway through the serialisation of the novel. It was by the artist Daniel Maclise, and had been commissioned by Dickens's publishers, Chapman and Hall. Nicholas Nickleby is typical of many early English novels, being focused on one person's life, and as such is more of a fictional biography than being especially plot-driven. Unlike his preceding novel, "Oliver Twist", the title character of this is already a young man with family responsibilities at the start of the novel. His future is very uncertain, due to the death of his father, who had made some poor investments. The readers sees that the major conflict in this novel is going to be the struggle of a small family to make their way in the world after suffering a tragic loss. To some extent, this is autobiographical. The Nickleby family are genteel but impoverished. Dickens's own personal struggles and experiences as a young man were similar, since his father had also forfeited his gentility because of financial incompetence. In Nicholas Nickleby we are introduced to the protagonist's uncle, Ralph Nickleby, very near the beginning. As soon as Ralph comes on the scene we realise this will add spice to the situation. For what a miserable old skinflint he is, "there was something in his very wrinkles, and in his cold restless eye, which seemed to tell of cunning that would announce itself in spite of him."Ralph takes against Nicholas right from the start, apparently purely based on envy, because Nicholas is young, bright and open. At this point we realise he is destined to be Nicholas's antagonist. And the warning bells begin to ring when we are told that Ralph Nickleby is unscrupulous in his financial dealings, because Nicholas has turned to his uncle for assistance, hoping for support for his mother and sister after the death of his father. Very quickly then, we identify Ralph as "the villain of the piece". And Dickens gives full rein to his talent for inventing over-the-top characters, who stay in the mind far longer than the details of the story itself. Who can forget the grotesque headmaster Wackford Squeers, with his,"one eye when the popular prejudice is in favour of two."Or Mrs Nickleby with her rapid barrage of discursions which would put Mrs. Bennet of Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" to shame? Or the kindly, generous benefactors, the Cheeryble brothers, Charles and Ned, who have built a thriving business on treating others with respect and compassion. They address each other as "my dear fellow" and not only look and act alike but also dress alike and wear white hats. As well as the main characters there are a myriad of minor eccentric characters in this novel, all of whom are a delight. Blink and you may miss them! The Crummles's family of actors, with their daughter Ninette, the starry "Infant Phenomenon", who at the age of ten had, "been precisely the same age - not perhaps to the full extent of the memory of the oldest inhabitant, but certainly for five good years. But she had been kept up late every night, and put upon an unlimited allowance of gin-and-water from infancy, to prevent her growing tall, and perhaps this system of training had produced in the infant phenomenon these additional phenomena."The other actors, unsurprisingly, were none too keen on her privileged position. The leading man Mr Folair termed her the "Infernal Phenomenon"! Then there is Mrs. Mantalini, the astute business-woman who owns a dressmaking and millinery shop, for whom Nicholas's sister Kate is sent to work as a seamstress, and her husband, a foppish fellow with extravagent tastes, given to histrionics and repeated attempts to kill himself. There is the fun-loving but ultimately self-seeking Kenwigs family, the revolting, lusting, scheming old man Arthur Gride, denounced as a wretch and a villain, and the dastardly nobleman whom we all want to boo, Sir Mulberry Hawk. The names too are typical Dickens whimsy, chosen with an eye to amuse and appeal. "Dotheboys Hall, the vile school where the boys were well and truly "done to", with Wackford Squeers as its headmaster, overkeen on whacking his pupils. Miss Knag - the spiteful forewoman of the dressmakers and milliners. There is Lord Frederick Verisoft - soft of brain - "weak and silly", his friend the Honourable Mr Snobb, and Sir Mulberry Hawk - "the most knowing card in the pack" - who treats everyone, including his "friends", as his prey. The Cheeryble brothers; now who can read their name without smiling? Mrs Wititterly who seems to witter a lot and has "an air of sweet insipidity". There is such a superfluity of names, some in characters who shine brightly for a paragraph or two, and then disappear without trace. There is Mr Crowl, who "utters a low querulous growl", and perhaps the best of the lot, Sir Tumley Snuffim, who is perhaps not such a good doctor if his patients "snuff it"!All the episodes with these larger than life characters seem tailor-made for the stage. Many of the speeches seem to cry out for an actor's ringing declamation on stage in a 19th century melodrama. Nicholas's way of talking is very stilted, and sadly, this stiff formal kind of language sometimes does alienate the modern reader, such as this, a simple acquiescence, "It's not in my nature... to resist any entreaty, unless it is to do something positively wrong; and, beyond a feeling of pride, I know nothing which should prevent my doing this. I know nobody here, and nobody knows me. So be it then. I yield."Dickens does indulge his love of all things theatrical in this novel, with a large part of the action being devoted to scenes in Portsmouth, where Nickleby aka "Mr Johnson" both writes and performs in the acting troupes, much as Dickens himself did. Perhaps this was deliberately so, because he dedicates it to his friend, the distinguished actor and theatre director William Macready. You can see Dickens's love of the theatre in almost every scene here. But this makes the tragic scenes so much more powerful, because of the contrasting comic scenes. And who, out of the general reading population of the time, would really have stayed with a piece of tragic literature about their contemporaries - including the poorest of them all - had it not been made so hugely entertaining? It's a real rarity for the time, for an author to focus on the lives of such poor people. Noggs and Smike are fully developed characters, but few of Dickens's contemporaries - Thackeray for instance - would bother with them. Dickens is quite deliberately appealing to the common people. He has "the common touch" and Trollope's disparaging nickname for him of "Mr Popular Sentiment" is perhaps not given without a certain amount of malicious envy. The characters here are very much larger than life characters, but the main characters we are following are more sensitively drawn. Madeline Bray is an heroic, brave character, beautiful and self-sacrificing, going through agonies of mind as she stays loyal to her father depite his despicable deeds. The reader is positively willing for her to have a good end. The character of Smike, the ex-Dotheboys Hall boy, is portrayed in such an affecting way, without resort to sentiment, that Dickens manages to tug at our heart-strings whenever he comes into the action. Then there are those others such as Newman Noggs, whom we know has fallen into the service and clutches of Ralph Nickleby through his own weakness for drink. Yet throughout we are willing him to somehow escape, recognising that here is a man of worth and principle. He is virtually a guardian angel to Nicholas, because of his benevolence and integrity. Dickens makes it abundantly clear to his readers just who are the goodies, and who are the baddies. This is at root an entertainment of a novel, although one very much designed to expose a scandal of the time.For just as "Oliver Twist" was intended to alert the largest possible audience to the scandal of the workhouses in the light of the recent changes to the Poor Law, Nicholas Nickleby was deliberately written to expose the ugly truth about Yorkshire boarding schools. In the preface to the novel Dickens calls Yorkshire schoolmasters,"Traders in the avarice, indifference, or imbecility of parents, and the helplessness of children; ignorant, sordid, brutal men, to whom few considerate persons would have entrusted the board and lodging of a horse or a dog" Then in his second preface, to the 1848 Cheap Edition, he notes that such schools as Dotheboys were common in Yorkshire at the time of writing but had begun to disappear,"This story was begun, within a few months after the publication of the completed "Pickwick Papers." There were, then, a good many cheap Yorkshire schools in existence. There are very few now."Such then was the power of a Dickens novel to influence popular opinion. When a great author of such stature and persuasive ability aimed his satirical voice at one social problem after another, both society and Parliament itself rapidly moved to change things. His fiction influenced both public perception and social reform, and this is one of the reasons he is truly a great author. We know that prior to Nicholas Nickleby, Dickens had seen advertisements in the London papers for cheap boarding schools in Yorkshire. It was stressed that there were "no holidays" from these schools. Dickens's antennae must have gone up, as he knew they were a convenient place to dispose of unwanted or illegitimate children. During the writing of "Oliver Twist" Dickens and his friend, Hablot Browne (who was to illustrate the book) had travelled in secret to Yorkshire to investigate these schools in January 1838. There they met William Shaw, the headmaster of Bowes Academy. The neglect and maltreatment at this notorious school was responsible for the blindness of several boys, and some actually died as a consequence. There is no doubt that Dickens intended the headmaster Wackford Squeers to be a portrayal of William Shaw, and that Dotheboys Hall was Bowes Academy. It became so infamous that "Bowes Academy", eventually (by 1903) became known as "Dotheboys Hall"!Many of the other characters were also based on real life people. The character of Miss La Crevy, who befriended the Nickleby family, was based on the actual person, Rosa Emma Drummond, who painted a miniature engraved portrait of Dickens on ivory. Dickens had commissioned this, so that he could give it to his fiancee, Catherine Hogarth as an engagement present. Like Miss Drummond, Miss La Creevy, was a good-natured, middle-aged miniature painter, described by Dickens as a "mincing young lady of fifty". Vincent Crummles and his daughter "The Infant Phenomenon" were based on the actor-manager T. D. Davenport and his nine year old prodigy of a daughter, Jean. "Infant phenomena" were a regular feature of many theatrical shows during the early decades of the nineteenth century. Davenport and his daughter appeared on the Portsmouth stage in March 1837. Dickens's own mother, Elizabeth Dickens, was the model for Mrs. Nickleby. Luckily for Charles she didn't recognise herself in the character. In fact she asked someone if they, "really believed there ever was such a woman"!And most surprising and notable of all is that the Cheeryble brothers were based on real life characters too! They are based on two benefactors who were brothers, Daniel and William Grant. They came from Scotland, but settled in Ramsbottom in Greater Manchester (although during Dickens's time, this will have been thought of as part of the county of Lancashire.) Some of the fine houses they built are still there. For instance, St. Andrew's Church from 1832 is also known as Grant's Church. It was originally consecrated as a Scottish Presbyterian Chapel, with a donation of £5,000 by William Grant. The Grant brothers regularly gave money to promising new enterprises and for education, supporting schools, libraries and the charitable institutions, and when homes and farmlands on Speyside were swept away by floods in 1829, gave £100 to swell "The Flood Fund". Dickens was keen to make sure everyone knew of these remarkable pair. This is from his preface, in May, 1848,"It may be right to say that there are 2 characters in this book which are drawn from life. Those who take an interest in this tale will be glad to learn that the Brothers Cheeryble do live; that their liberal charity, their singleness of heart, noble nature and unbounded benevolence are no creatures of the author’s brain, but are prompting every day some munificent and generous deed in that town of which they are the pride and honour." He was writing at breakneck speed again. "Oliver Twist" had overlapped "The Pickwick Papers" by 10 months, and when he started "Nicholas Nickleby", "Oliver Twist" was still a long way from being completed. So perhaps the persuasive writing he was so keen on, the social conscience he displayed in his writing in the early part of this novel, feels very familiar, because it was written on the same days as the latter half of Oliver Twist. He was also, of course, doing his editing work too. Dickens seemed to delight in working under pressure at high speed!What the reader takes away from this novel is mainly a memory of the dramatic, eccentric and unique characters, although probably only a fraction of the total proliferation stay with us. We may remember the plot too. Yet credit should also be given to Dickens's masterly powers of description, which are also very apparent in Nicholas Nickleby. Often Dickens will exaggerate for effect, or use personification, or even the pathetic fallacy, where he is keen to convey a mood. He is adept at attributing human qualities and emotions to inanimate objects. Here's a wonderful description of Arthur Gride,"a little old man, of about seventy or seventy-five years of age, of a very lean figure, much bent and slightly twisted. He wore... such scanty trousers as displayed his shrunken spindle-shanks in their full ugliness...His nose and chin were sharp and prominent, his jaws had fallen inwards from loss of teeth, his face was shrivelled and yellow, save where the cheeks were streaked with the colour of a dry winter apple; and where his beard had been, there lingered yet a few grey tufts which seemed, like the ragged eyebrows, to denote the badness of the soil from which they sprung. The whole air and attitude of the form was one of stealthy cat-like obsequiousness; the whole expression of the face was concentrated in a wrinkled leer, compounded of cunning, lecherousness, slyness, and avarice."And here is his house,"an old house, dismal dark and dusty, which seemed to have withered, like himself, and to have grown yellow and shrivelled in hoarding him from the light of day, as he had in hoarding his money... Meagre old chairs and tables, of spare and bony make, and hard and cold as misers' hearts, were ranged, in grim array, against the gloomy walls; attenuated presses, grown lank and lantern-jawed in guarding the treasures they enclosed, and tottering, as though from constant fear and dread of thieves, shrunk up in dark corners, whence they cast no shadows on the ground, and seemed to hide and cower from observation." Arthur Gride's house, thus seems to take on the aspect of a living creature itself, as though the essence of its inhabitant had oozed into the very fibres of the house and its contents. Of course it is exaggerated and whimsical rather than realistic, but it is brilliantly described. Here's another example, where a different house is described. It feels less organic, but holds more of a portent. Kate Nickleby has this to say of the house Ralph acquires for them,"This house depresses and chills one and seems as if some blight had fallen on it. If I were superstitious, I should be almost inclined to believe that some dreadful crime had been perpetrated within these old walls, and that the place had never prospered since. How frowning and how dark it looks!"So this house seems to foreshadow the sinister plans that Ralph has for Kate. Both of these to me show Dickens's supreme craft as a writer. Nicholas Nickleby is partly a "bildungsroman" - a story about the coming of age of the main character - and partly a social commentary on injustice. The maltreatment of children in the educational system features highly throughout, with Dickens using all the tricks of the trade to persuade his readers; pathos, comedy, satire, and powerful storytelling. He also employs coincidences, which we all love in life, and melodrama, which heightened the entertainment value at the time it was written. As well as focusing on the private Yorkshire poor schools, savagely condemning those responsible for the system that treated children so cruelly, it also indicts those who use fraudulent financial tactics and other dishonest business practices. There is certainly a memorable plot, and it could be thought of as "Three Weddings and a Funeral" - but there are two funerals here, and they are poles apart. They are both highly dramatic and tragic, because they are ultimately both avoidable.So is it the funniest novel in the English language? Well it all depends on your taste. It is possibly the funniest novel ever written by Dickens himself. Yet it is also extremely poignant, sad, chilling, bitter and (it has to be said) overblown and melodramatic. It is by turns absurd, comic, tragic and moving. It is quintessentially Charles Dickens. If you love Dickens, you'll love this one - don't miss it!

	1.Great Expectations: 2020 reviewI first read Great Expectations in ninth grade—an age when there was no way I could possibly appreciate any aspect of it. Revisiting it later in life showed me that it is a truly fantastic novel, and now I’ve been thrilled to read it aloud to the family in the evenings and enjoy it all over again. Dickens’s riff on the Prodigal Son story is full of heart-rending emotion and hilarious comedy. Pip’s hindsight perspective on himself is stunning—and the ability of Dickens to put himself in the place not only of the young Pip in the story but also of the older Pip reminiscing about his younger self.Every time I read this I’m sure different aspects will be memorable. This time the little detail that we all enjoyed was the many ways Dickens avoids saying “he died.” Those verbose, paragraph-long euphemisms for death are incredible. There’s no one like Dickens for finding tortuously wordy ways of saying simple, mundane things. Reading it aloud brings this out perhaps even more, because there are times when I’d finish a sentence and then have to pause while we all tried to work out what had just happened in the sentence—often followed by uproarious laughter.------------------------------------A Tale of Two Cities: 2018 reviewI don't know if I'd read A Tale of Two Cities since 10th grade (I think it used to be required reading for a lot of us in school in those days). I remember enjoying it back then, but I wasn't prepared to return to it and find that it is such a brilliant, hilarious, exciting story. My wife, who has taught the novel a number of times in high school classes, suggested that we all read it together as bedtime stories. I thought at first that this was a crazy idea, because I know how complicated Dickens's sentences can be, and how long it might take us to get through the book. And as we started it, I still thought it was kind of a crazy idea, because the beginning starts rather slowly and demands a lot of intuitive, contextual understanding. But once the characters and setting are established, the story quickly starts moving toward its inevitable conclusion, and it was extremely fun to share together in the evenings.I remembered the general outline of the narrative, but I'd forgotten many details along the way. In particular, I didn't remember the full character arc of Jerry Cruncher, nor did I remember the climactic confrontation between two very strong female characters. I doubt 10th-grade me understood Mr. Lorry very well, and now I find him fascinating and admirable. I did remember loving Sidney Carton, but looking back at him from middle age is even better than looking up to him from youth. Were we to have another son, I think "Sidney Carton" would be a great choice for his name. I really resonated with so much of Carton's struggle against darkness and hopelessness. I always find it hard to write anything worthwhile about a long and beautiful novel such as this one. I don't think I'll let so many years pass before revisiting A Tale of Two Cities.

But I figured they had to be called "classics" for a reason. I just finished A Tale of Two Cities which is divided into 3 sections. I started out thinking "see this is why I never read classics" but by the end I was thinking "I can't believe it's taken me this long to read a classic, it was brilliant!" It did take me till the end of section 2 to finally figure out what the heck was going on and who everyone was. I was determined to finish this book and continued to give it a chance. After that point the book was hard to put down and lived up to how Jonathan Franzen described it: "a page turner". I'm glad Oprah chose this book, A Tale of Two Cities would have probably been the last classic I would have chosen to read. But I'm glad I did. It was a powerful story of ultimate love and self sacrifice as well as ultimate evil and horror. I liked the historical aspect of the book, learning about the French revolution. The suspense was intense and the story touches your soul in a way things rarely do. At the end tears were streaming down my face and blurring my eyes where I could hardly finish the book. Bravo, Charles Dickens, bravo.

	1.The Pickwick Papers was the first novel by Charles Dickens but I’ve read it last. I was always afraid to start but once I did it proved to be a real pageturner for me.There sat the man who had traced to their source the mighty ponds of Hampstead, and agitated the scientific world with his Theory of Tittlebats, as calm and unmoved as the deep waters of the one on a frosty day, or as a solitary specimen of the other in the inmost recesses of an earthen jar.The peculiar and effervescent sense of humour is inimitable and the language is like the vintage wine.And I was surprised to find out that quite a few of the inns the clubmen stayed in are still functioning.

The novel's main character, Samuel Pickwick, Esquire, is a kind and wealthy old gentleman, the founder and perpetual president of the Pickwick Club. To extend his researches into the quaint and curious phenomena of life, he suggests that he and three other "Pickwickians" (Mr Nathaniel Winkle, Mr Augustus Snodgrass, and Mr Tracy Tupman) should make journeys to places remote from London and report on their findings to the other members of the club. Their travels throughout the English countryside by coach provide the chief theme of the novel. A distinctive and valuable feature of the work is the generally accurate description of the old coaching inns of England.

It is particularly memorable for its symbolism, the way it uses a series of "dust mounds" (huge heterogeneous piles of waste, primarily of cinders and ash, waiting to be recycled as bricks) owned by the "Golden Dustman" to represent great fortunes, their barrenness and avarice, and their harmful effects on an increasingly money-mad society.

It also contains--as does all Dickens--a range of vivid scenes and memorable characters: harrowing glimpses of riverfront lowlife contrasted with wonderful comic scenes of nouveau riche display, a particularly vicious pair of married grifters, an ambiguous young lawyer and dandy who turns out to be something like a hero, and (perhaps a late apology for Fagin) an evil goy moneylender who uses a kindly Jew as a front. One reason this novel has gained in popularity during the last century is that it is as close as Dickens ever gets to a meta-fiction. The reading and interpretations of various texts--exemplified by Silas Wegg's oral reading of Gibbon's Decline and Fall to the illiterate Noddy Boffin, and their subsequent discussions--is an important metaphor here.

      The Old Curiosity Shop
Rating:

	1.The Old Curiosity Shop was the most popular of Dickens's novels during his lifetime. Yet now there is perhaps no other novel by him which splits opinion so much. How can that be?The simple answer is that tastes change. Just as with modern-day fantasy stories the reader has to suspend their disbelief, accepting the basic premise of the magical or dystopian world described, with Dickens one has to "go along with" his unique view of the world. Yes, he was writing about everyday characters and the highs and lows of their lives. His novels are very much rooted in reality, or they would not have had such an influence on legislation and the public perceptions of the day. But in a way they are also peopled with characters of fantasy. He will refer to "the fairy" or "the goblin" and this is how he views those characters. Their physical descriptions, mannerisms and behaviour all fit the type. Once you buy into the whole package, you realise that this is not a hopelessly sentimental or unrealistic view, but a fabulous tale of good versus evil with a great dollop of chance, and marvellous fairies and grotesques around every corner. And the characters? Oh, the characters! There are literally dozens of cameo pieces. They jump out of the book at every opportunity, these highly coloured images demanding attention, having but a brief, short life of perhaps a few paragraphs at most, before their vitality sizzles and dies, never again to be encountered by the reader. Who remembers Mr Slum, who was trying to persuade Mrs. Jarley to employ his services as a poet in helping to advertise the waxworks? Vividly described, he is actually based on a person Dickens remembered from his horrific days at Warren's Blacking Factory. But he vanishes from the pages without trace. There is the unbearably snooty Miss Maltravers, the hypocritical monster of a teacher, with a crocodile of young ladies trailing in her wake. Unforgiveably, she makes Little Nell cry - and is then never seen again. There is Tom Scott, the only character in the entire novel, apart from Quilp's downtrodden wife, who genuinely seems to like Quilp. Tom has a penchant for standing on his head and walking on his hands; he later becomes a professional tumbler. But often these characters appear for an instant, sparkle brightly, then disappear never to be be seen again.On every page too, there is the fingerprint of the author, for Dickens has a unique way of telling a story. Even when describing a harrowing or tragic episode, he will still manage to somehow make the reader smile. In the main he does this through his characters, and he will also anthropomorphise his animals. Dickens will even personify objects or buildings; it is all grist to his mill of engaging his readers, and if at all possible, amusing us at the same time. His style combines exaggeration, hyperbole, sarcasm, irony, good humour, a sense of the absurd, a strong sense of injustice - all these combined in a formula which is essentially the recipe for the human condition, and reaches a pinnacle in the writing of "The Inimitable" Charles Dickens. Of course, all this can only be experienced through reading the text. The best dramatisation in the world cannot convey any of these linguistic devices. Yet Dickens's stories are perennially popular, adapted for films, TV, radio and stage, and have been retold in numerous ways ever since they were written. Quite an achievement for an author whom some class as "dull"!So what is the story about, and who are the main characters? Well the story started life as a series of sketches for Dickens's weekly magazine, "Master Humphrey's Clock". Dickens's original idea was that the magazine should be similar to "The Pickwick Papers", with an old man surrounded by a group of friends, who would all relate stories to each other. They would all read out their own manuscripts, the proceedings being presided over by Master Humphrey. The magazine contained a few of these short stories, plus the first episodes of both The Old Curiosity Shop and later "Barnaby Rudge". He had started to include a serial expressly because sales of the magazine had begun to drop. The public were disappointed by "Master Humphrey's Clock", but were quickly intrigued by the story of The Old Curiosity Shop. It captured the public's imagination, and after Dickens had written the first three chapters, being the astute businessman that he was, with an eye for what whetted the public's appetite, he decided to turn it into a full novel. Here is the author, in a preface to a later edition of the novel,"Master Humphrey (before his devotion to the bread and butter business) was originally supposed to be the narrator of the story. As it was constructed from the beginning, however, with a view to separate publication when completed, his demise has not involved the necessity of any alteration."He thus neatly got out of any rewriting, although a modern reader is left with an abandoned first person narrator at the end of chapter 3. From the reader's point of view, the voice of the narrator has felt particularly personal up to that point. It is easy to recognise him, even from the very first words of the book, "Night is generally my time for walking."Now anyone who knows anything about Charles Dickens's life, will recognise the author from this. He used to walk for miles, and for hours on end, all over London - and often at night.Then in the novel the narrator tells us, at the end of the third chapter, that he is going to disappear, and from then on, presumably, we will have an omniscient narrator. Oddly, this works. Dickens has already created an atmosphere of mystery, tension and intrigue. We have two abominable grotesques, an old musty house full of "curiosities", and a tiny "fairylike" child. We have been hooked right from the start by the questions the author/narrator also feels. Where does the old man go every night and why? And is he really rich? The upshot of these disjointed events is that the reader, who is already feeling an unworldly sense with this novel, is put on edge even more, and feels a little disturbed and dislocated. At this point it could easily turn into one of Dickens's ghost stories.Once Dickens had freed himself from the constraints of "Master Humphrey's Clock", he was able to give free rein to the story of The Old Curiosity Shop. He was free to expand on his original idea, increasing the suspense, and interweaving unforgettable characters into the action. There are the main characters, such as the malicious and shudderingly evil, hateful, misshapen, dwarf moneylender Daniel Quilp. Descriptions of him are abundant, always emphasising his sub-human qualities, threatening to "bite" people - and even the poor dog - all the time. When asleep he was,"hanging so far out of his bed that he almost seemed to be standing on his head, and whom, either from the uneasiness of this posture or in one of his agreeable habits, was gasping and growling with his mouth wide open, and the whites (or rather the dirty yellows) of his eyes distinctly visible."Quilp revels in plotting the downfall of those around him, and maliciously making a misery of the lives of his nearest and dearest, his shadow of a wife Betsy and her mother Mrs Jiniwin. We meet Sampson and Sally Brass, lawyers, the obsequious brother and dragon of a sister, a sparring duo who provide much comic relief whilst being integral to the plot. Here is a portrait of the charming Sally, of whom, by the way, Quilp is much enamoured,".... the lady carried upon her upper lip certain reddish demonstrations, which, if the imagination had been assisted by her attire, might have been mistaken for a beard. These were, however, in all probability, nothing more than eyelashes in a wrong place, as the eyes of Miss Brass were quite free from any such natural impertinencies. In complexion Miss Brass was sallow - rather a dirty sallow, so to speak - but this hue was agreeably relieved by the healthy glow which mantled in the extreme tip of her laughing nose."There are the young heroes, Dick Swiveller - often rather the worse for drink, disinclined to work, full of blather; a careless rogue, but essentially honest and true, "Mr Richard Swiveller wending his way homeward after this fashion, which is considered by evil-minded men to be symbolical of intoxication, and is not held by such persons to denote that state of deep wisdom and reflection in which the actor knows himself to be," and Kit Nubbins, a salt of the earth, devoted both to Nell and his mother, but not really very bright and easily taken advantage of. There are the Garlands, a kind and generous couple, who put the reader in mind of the benevolence of the Cheeryble brothers in "Nicholas Nickleby". Eccentric characters abound, and many have the most wonderful names: Sophie Wackles, a flighty young girl, Codlin and Short, proprietor and puppeteer of a Punch and Judy show, Isaac List and Joe Jowl, crafty gamblers, Mr Chuckster, an annoying windbag, who is the Clerk to Mr Witherden, not to mention the renamed servant, "Sophronia Sphynx". Yet in this novel Dickens seeks to increase the mystery even further by deliberately keeping the names of some characters from us, sometimes right up to the end. There is "the Small Servant", "the Marchioness", "the Single Gentleman", "the Bachelor". And even Nell Trent's grandfather, a pivotal character in the book, is not given a first name. "The fairy" is of course Little Nell, usually referred to as "the child". "The goblin" is the grotesque dwarf Quilp, quite possibly the most evil villain ever to spring from Dickens's pen. The parts containing these characters are the myth, the fairytale, the eternal struggle of good versus evil, the parts where we want to cheer on our heroes, our angels and fairies, and boo the goblins and baddies. It is also an unworldly doom-laden thread of the story. Simon Callow calls it,"an extraordinary and complex novel, which summons up an almost Wagnerian world with its dwarf and its gold, a cautionary tale about capitalism... It is astounding that Dickens should have whipped up this whole elaborate fable out of thin air, more or less overnight, quickly extrapolating it out of a little story he thought he might write about a sickly child and her grandfather, in order to keep faith with his public; he never pleased them more with anything."Indeed, when published as a novel this gave fresh impetus to the serialisation. The mystery continued right through the story, now given added depth and complexity by virtue of its novel status. It took the public by storm, selling an astonishing hundred thousand copies a week, and for the last episode Dickens was inundated with letters from both sides of the Atlantic, begging him to spare Little Nell's life. When the last instalment arrived by ship, crowds in New York were shouting from the pier, "Is Little Nell dead?" Dickens himself had had great difficulty in deciding this point, with so much of his public pleading for a reprieve. Even William Charles Macready, the great actor to whom Dickens had dedicated his previous novel, "Nicholas Nickleby" begged Dickens to let Little Nell live. Dickens's friend, mentor and biographer, John Forster, advised the opposite, telling him that Little Nell should die, "so that the gentle little pure figure and form should never change to the fancy". Dickens finished writing The Old Curiosity Shop at 4am on January 17th, 1841. The story had been serialised for ten months, and Dickens had been in torment over the planned ending, unable to bring himself to write it, living the experience so vividly that he could not make his characters face the death of their heroine, "I tremble to approach the place a great deal more than Kit; a great deal more than Mr. Garland; a great deal more than the Single Gentleman.... I am slowly murdering that poor child. It wrings my heart. (view spoiler)[Yet it must be. (hide spoiler)]"The whole depiction of Nell was a reworking of Mary Hogarth, Dickens's real life sister-in-law who had died three years earlier at the age of 17. Dickens never really got over this loss, although there are indications in The Old Curiosity Shop that he was beginning to come to terms with it. There are several scenes set in a neglected graveyard, with Little Nell musing on thoughts of death. For much of the book she had been in a virtual trance - always wondering if she was awake or asleep - and this seemed to increase until she seemed to achieve a kind of serenity, and an acceptance of her fate. In the graveyard Nell, "grieves to think that those who die about us are so soon forgotten" but was told that unvisited graves were the inspiration of good thoughts and actions by those who remembered the ones who had died but who themselves went on living. Of course, the more obvious interpretations of the graveyard scenes are as portents and metaphors, foreshadowing what may be to come.To a modern eye at least, there are many themes in the novel we may easily recognise. Alienation is a primary theme. Each character is in their own little world, often friendless, and with little power to influence their circumstances. Thus there is entrapment and loss of freedom. Creativity is there too, the creativity of Quilp to reinvent himself according to circumstances, and in the character of Dick Swiveller, to a lesser extent. It is tempting too to take a 21st century view of Quilp. What has happened to damage this character; to make him so intent on causing so much pain, devoting all his energies to planning destruction and ruin? Had he been abandoned or illtreated as a child? Was it other people's perceptions of his difference or deformity which lay at the root of his behaviour? But the truth is probably that he was just Dickens's "goblin". Materialism is a paramount theme, naturally. The whole novel hinges on money - the lack of it, and the deceptions involved in acquiring it. This novel is more similar to "Oliver Twist" than either of the other novels by Dickens which precede it. In both there is a naive and supremely good central character; in both it is a child who actually acts as if they are an adult. Nell may be "nearly 14" at the beginning of the novel, but is perceived by all as a child. And Dickens makes sure the reader never forgets this by constantly referring to her as "the child". Both children have special qualities of innocence, forgiveness, endurance, and martyrdom. Both novels chronicle the journey of these children, and the events which ensue from that. In The Old Curiosity Shop we also follow the journey of Dick, which parallels it. Nell's journey is a life and death one, Dick's is more psychological, but they mirror each other to a great extent.In both these novels we see two more of Dickens's recurring themes. One is the damage done to children by foolish and reckless parents and grandparents. The other is the paradox of financial security. In Dickens's world, if it has been gained at the expense of morality, it is meaningless and will result in a terrible fate. For Dickens both of these were private and personal wounds; episodes and paradoxes from his own life, which he constantly thrashed out in his own mind, and made his characters play out. Was it ever possible to live a morally good life and also keep safe and well? Dickens interpolated episodes from his own fancy - the circus troupe, the waxworks and so on. All of these enjoyably entertaining episodes are Dickens indulging his whimsy, his penchant for all things theatrical. But the grim industrial scenes of the furnaces, based on those in Birmingham at the time; the grinding poverty and scenes of individuals trapped in a living death, are depressingly real. In these we have a glimpse of the Dickens who is to write the truly great socially aware novels of his middle period.Perhaps the best description of the effective formula for writing a serialised novel such as The Old Curiosity Shop comes from Wilkie Collins. Now we remember him from his own classic novels. But in this context, he was Charles Dickens's friend, and a fellow writer who had his material published in Dickens's magazines. His advice to writers hoping to be included in Dickens's magazine?"Make them laugh, make them cry, make them wait."With The Old Curiosity Shop we have exactly that experience - in abundance. Plus in the final chapter we have, as always, a satisfying explanation of what has happened to all the main characters. Even the cantankerous and self-willed horse "Whiskers", whose antics more than once released the tension from a particularly harrowing part of the story, is given his own summing-up, his own "happy ending" in the final chapter. Oscar Wilde may have remarked, (view spoiler)[

So, does it actually exist, this "Old Curiosity Shop"? Well, yes. In all probability it is a building on Portsmouth Street, Holborn, London. It was built in 1567, and Dickens often used to visit it. Later it was named "The Old Curiosity Shop" in honour of his novel, and is now quite famous.

	1.This is a group read with the following people: myself. Yes, this has got to be the loneliest group read I have ever participated in. The novel is an unfinished mystery from a classic of English literature. In the unfinished form my edition has around 230 pages and the actual mystery happens at 66% of the book length. Thus if I say what exactly the mystery is for all practical purposes it would be a complete spoiler. However from the title is can be deduced the mystery is connected to one of the character, Edwin Drood. This young guy lives with his uncle John Jasper. He is betrothed to a beautiful girl Rosa Bud (the couple's fathers took care of this way before their kids understood what it means). Most of the novel takes place in a provincial town called Cloisterham. The sleepy town still has its own shares of excitements - I mean for such place anything breaking the routine constitutes excitement, like coming of orphan twins - Neville and Helena Landless. They were literally dumped in the place by a Philanthropic Society of London. While Helena quickly befriended Rosa, Neville started behaving like a jackass or whatever was the term in the Victorian Britain. At least the gossip mongers had their hands full trying to stay abreast with the new arrivals. If you think this is not enough to make the story interesting let me mention that the first chapter takes place in a London opium den with what surely considered to be disturbing visions at the time of writing. Before I started composing my own review I read other people's thoughts about the novel looking for inspiration. Surprising number of reviewers give low rating because the tale was unfinished. Huh? How is it logical? The guy was laboriously writing the story until his death - unlike some modern writers I do not care to mention. It is not his fault he died before finishing. I strongly suspect had the author had a choice in the matter, he would have chosen to live longer (and finishing the book as a result). While I am on the subject let me mention how the book ends. The identity of the villain is very much clear. It is almost as much clear how the crime was committed and the main clue overlooked in otherwise very careful planning. It is also possible to figure out the identity of the investigator with the high probability. How exactly the tale was supposed to end in anybody's guess.Thus my fairly low rating is not due to this. The rating is influenced by the fact that this is simply not Dickens' best work, or even among his best. He could do much better - and he did elsewhere. For starters I began to think some genres are not compatible with each other. In this case a serious mystery simply refused to cooperate with satire despite the considerable writing abilities of the author. Some characters and situations came straight from satirical stories - just read practically every scene involving Thomas Sapsea and Luke Honeythunder. The mystery itself is very much serious matter. My personal nitpick: I do not like the use of present tense. In here present and past tenses are mixed and once again Dickens' writing skills almost - but not quite - made it work. There was even no good reason of doing it here by the way.On the positive side you can see the writing of a Master. New and inspiring writers really need to read his descriptions to see how it is done. For example his description of Cloisterham was fairly short and made the town truly alive in my imagination. On the other hand he spent one page describing a closet which was forgotten as soon as the description was finished, but this was the only such example. If you want to see this taken into the level of ridiculousness read anything by Victor Hugo. Anyhow even minor efforts by Dickens are well worth reading, but this time it was not an easy read. As a side note my edition has discovered fragments of Mr. Sapsea's tale. Not only they do not move the story by an inch, they also contain none of the characters from the published part except for Mr. Sapsea himself. From this point of view it was a completely pointless addition.

	1.Letter from the ‘umble Reader to the ‘onourable Master Dickens! Part One, - which expresses slight confusion regarding the title of this chef d’oeuvre, Martin Chuzzlewit! My dear Dickens! Despite the fact that there is not just one, but two important main characters called Martin Chuzzlewit, it seems to me that they are not deserving of the title, all things considered. The editors obviously knew that when they printed the Wordsworth Classics edition, as they put a portrait of the infamous Mr Pecksniff on the front cover instead. A very Pecksniffian thing to do, indeed! Stealing the honour, the show, and the centre stage from the true main characters, who are far too kind and shy to claim their rights to title and portrait. If there is any justice to be had in the city of London, the title should undoubtedly be: “Tom Pinch and Mark Tapley”, for they are the heroes of the rollercoaster story on greed, misunderstanding, family conflicts, culture clash and murder!After long considerations however, the Reader does not advise Pinch and Tapley to go to court, as that would only lead to their participation in Bleak House rather than Martin Chuzzlewit. And while being crucial to the dénouement of their own novel, they would probably just add to the confusion of the overpopulated Chancery. Part Two, - which expresses deeply felt gratitude to the Author for offering yet another masterpiece of world class, adding the charm of a cultural exchange between America and England and a highly entertaining crime story to the well-known Dickensian mix of character study and societal peculiarities.Deeply in love with the whole Dickensian universe, I will give this one a clear lead when it comes to witty, nuanced characters and funny situations. I spent lovely days in a reading frenzy, laughing out loud many, many times at the beautifully described absurdity of human life. Little did I know that the habit of blaming teachers for children’s lack of respect and learning was so old. I used to think it a recent phenomenon to hear parents spit fire in rude, anti-eloquent language, cursing teachers’ inability to teach their children proper manners and vocabulary. Then I witnessed poor Ruth Pinch’s governess adventure in 19th century London, and reconsidered. It was exactly the same back then: the dumber the parents, the more a child’s failure is the fault of the teacher.Another aspect of modern life that turns out to be as old as Dickens is the dichotomy between American and European values, and its effect on intercontinental relations. This novel being Dickens’ hommage to ex-pat experience made me love it all the more. And he is so right when attributing Martin Chuzzlewit the Younger’s change of character to his widened perspective and global experience. Comparative social studies develop human characters for the better! But Eden, America is only for very, very tough travellers! A paradise in a swamp. In a few chapters, Dickens outlines the funniest contradictions in the American Dream - spot on!Part Three, - which bows to the literary precursor of Four Weddings And A Funeral, and expresses huge pleasure at the fact that a Not-Wedding can be the perfect happy end in some cases - depending on the character you ask! The “Never Yours” letter of emancipation will stay with me forever, - what a conclusion, Mr Moddle. Good luck on the Seven Seas!Conclusion, in which the devoted Reader expresses happiness, satisfaction and also a tiny bit of sadness at leaving yet another 800-page adventure in the company of Dickens behind!Magnificent! And there is nothing Pecksniffian in this praise. It comes from the bottom of my heart, and is as honest as Tapley and Pinch!Please accept my ‘umble Gratitude,Forever Yours,The Respectful Reader

	3.Martin Chuzzlewit, or “the American one”, as fans of Dickens often refer to it, is “The Inimitable”’s sixth novel, written and published in twenty monthly parts between January 1843 to July 1844, when its author was between 30 and 32. It is a typical Dickensian romp of a ride, with thrills, passion, savage mockery, suspense - and flashes of absurd humour amidst the despair. The novel lunges between hyperbole and whimsy, switching at a moment’s notice, and it contains some of Dickens’s most memorable characters. There is the seedy but charming schemer Montague Tigg (Tigg Montague), and his associate Chevy Slyme, the eccentrically fey and colourfully attired barber and bird-fancier Poll Sweedlepipe, the staunch ally Mark Tapley, the undertaker Mr Mould, the buxom good-hearted pub landlady Mrs Lupin, the poor addled old clerk Chuffey ... or is he really so confused? Who could ever forget Mrs Sairey Gamp, the booze-addicted midwife-cum-nurse who has her own mode of speech or idiolect? Who could forget the reported gushing flattery and compliments of her “employer” Mrs Harris, or her devious plots and hilarious squabbles with her associate Betsy Prig? Or who could not fall in love with the noble but naïve Tom Pinch, solid and unswerving in his loyalty, despite suffering gross insults and deprivations, or Mary Graham, of whom the same could be said, or his sister Ruth, a creation with whom it seems crystal clear the author himself fell in love.Oh, the characters! The names alone are enough to make the reader chuckle, and they were carefully designed by Dickens to do precisely that. He even fiddled about with the main character’s name, trying out Sweezleden, Sweezleback, Sweezlewag, Chuzzletoe, Chuzzleboy, Chubblewig, and Chuzzlewig, before settling on “Chuzzlewit”. The fully fleshed out versions pop into the reader's mind long after the novel has been finished, remaining long after the story itself, fascinating and devious though that is. For mention has still not been made of any characters in the American section, whose whimsical names include Jefferson Brick, General Fladdock, Major Pawkins, Hannibal Chollop, Captain Kedgick, Elijah Pogrom and General Cyrus Choke. (These bogus titles comprise part of Dickens poking fun at the American habit of bestowing honorary military titles, as is his observation that everyone Martin meets in America is “remarkable man”).Nor has mention been made of members of the large Chuzzlewit family itself: Anthony and Martin, the two feuding elderly brothers who drive the plot, or Jonas, Anthony's bully of a son, or the myriad of minor relatives who bookend the novel - and incidentally provide some of its most amusing moments. Nor of Jonas’s cousin, the young Martin, the namesake of his father, whose adventures we are to follow. And surely it would be a crime against literature to forget the character who arguably makes Martin Chuzzlewit the great novel it undoubtedly is ... the unforgettable ... Mr Pecksniff. It would be difficult to say who is the most memorable character, Sairey Gamp or Seth Pecksniff, (father of two priggish daughters, Charity and Mercy, cast from the same mould) - a smooth-talking hypocrite with his pious sanctimoniousness, so self-deluded that he seems to be unable to cast off his mask of virtue throughout. The novel is worth reading for these two alone. Any scene with either of them in makes the reader settle down with a smile on their face. The story may continue in its tragedy, the hairs on your neck may stand up at the horror or brutality - but then turn the next page and you may be splitting your sides at some absurd turn of phrase by Mrs Gamp, or the sanctimonious twaddle of Mr Pecksniff. Such is the skill of the author that not only can he write scathingly ironic satire, but he can provide sparks of humour; shafts of light within the powerful and evocative descriptions of the darkest and most dire situations. So what is the novel about? Put in a nutshell, it is about greed and selfishness. This theme raises its ugly head throughout the novel, being reflected and present in many of the minor characters and episodes, crossing all social classes, occupations and cultures. The primary focus however is on greed in regard to inheritance. John Forster, Dickens’s closest friend, mentor and biographer says,“The notion of taking Pecksniff for a type of character was really the origin of the book; the design being to show, more or less by every person introduced, the number and variety of humours and vices that have their root in selfishness.”So in a sense it could be said that Pecksniff is the hero - or anti-hero - of the book, although he is only one of many character strands to this complex story. Seth Pecksniff had his origin in an actual person, Samuel Carter Hall. Carter Hall was an Irish-born Victorian journalist who edited “The Art Journal” and was widely satirised at the time. He made Old Masters (such as Raphael or Titian's paintings) virtually unsaleable, by exposing the profits that custom-houses were earning by importing them. By doing this, he hoped to support modern British art by promoting young artists and attacking the market for unreliable Old Masters. However, he was deeply unsympathetic to the Pre-Raphaelites, and published several attacks upon the movement. Julian Hawthorne says,“such oily and voluble sanctimoniousness needed no modification to be fitted to appear before the footlights in satirical drama. He might be called an ingenuous hypocrite, an artless humbug, a veracious liar, so obviously were the traits indicated innate and organic in him rather than acquired ... His indecency and falsehood were in his soul, but not in his consciousness; so that he paraded them at the very moment that he was claiming for himself all that was their opposite.”It is a very short jump indeed from this description of Samuel Carter Hall to one of Seth Pecksniff!The other arguably strongest character, Mrs Gamp, was also an early inspiration, which came via Dickens’s rich philanthropic friend, Angela Burdett-Coutts. Later Burdett-Coutts was to co-found “Urania Cottage” with the author. “Urania Cottage” was a home for young women who had “turned to a life of immorality”, such as theft and prostitution. Additionally, this novel is dedicated to her. Angela Burdett-Coutts had told Dickens about a nurse who took care of her companion (and former governess) Hannah Meredith. The nurse was an eccentric character, and details such as her yellow nightcap, her fondness for snuff and for spirits, and her strange habit of rubbing her nose along the top of the tall fender were immediately seized on by Dickens, who then immortalised her in the unforgettable character of Mrs. Gamp. We easily become diverted by the characters, for Dickens is adept at discursiveness. But Dickens always has a huge persuasive element to his novels too, despite their apparent primary desire to entertain. Martin Chuzzlewit was written shortly after Dickens had taken a year off in 1842. During this time Dickens was in financial difficulty. He had borrowed money from his publishers in order to visit the United States of America, and his wife Kate was expecting their fifth child. John Forster notes,“Title and even story had been undetermined while we travelled” and “Beginning so hurriedly as at last he did, altering his course at the opening and seeing little as yet of the main track of his design,”The story which frames Dickens’s message was additionally altered considerably as Dickens wrote, in an attempt to revitalise flagging sales. In the sixth part, desperately hoping to win back his fans, Dickens has our young hero, Martin Chuzzlewit, go off to America, hoping that this would stimulate renewed interest in the book. From now on, he actually planned the events in the story beforehand. His previous novels had just grown and developed as he wrote them, shortly before each serial part was published, but Martin Chuzzlewit represented a difference in approach, and one which he was to continue.This has a dramatic impact on the novel itself. From a deceptively humorous start, containing some of Dickens’s sharpest satirical observations and wit, the novel switches to passages in America where the humour - at least for this reader - seems to lose its masterly touch. There are a couple of chapters which seem more to be Dickens venting some of his ill feelings for his dislike of the United States. It had been a colony up to less than a hundred years previously - almost within living memory - so he may well have suspected that some of his readers may have shared his feelings. His personal wrath was due mostly to what he saw as an invidious practice there of disregarding copyright. Dickens’s observation of American habits which he personally disliked, such as incessant tobacco-chewing and spitting, what he saw as greedy and uncouth table manners, plus a tendency to talk things up, which appeared to an outsider as disagreeable boasting - all these were savagely parodied, and the introduction to America afforded by this novel is single-mindedly bad. No character has any redeeming qualities, and an entire family, the Norrisses, is introduced (disappearing from the narrative for ever shortly afterwards) apparently solely to demonstrate the hypocrisy of the nation as a whole, across all strata. Others are characterised as buffoons, and to a man (or woman) they are acquisitive, placing gain and accolades above true worth and honour.This approach backfired. Not surprisingly it alienated all Dickens’s many American readers, who were outraged. Dickens took note, and the later American episodes, in the ironically named “Eden”, contain both good and bad characters, well portrayed rather than mere grotesque parodies. In addition, for every subsequent edition of the novel in perpetuity, Dickens left instructions to be printed, which offer an apology to the US citizens. This resulted from his second visit there. It is interesting to wonder, from a modern point of view, whether he would have liked to edit this part. Very possibly, given his Postscript, and it would seem unfair to downgrade an assessment of the book as a whole because of what after all is merely a couple of chapters. The scenes on board ship are graphic, and powerfully described, as well as providing an important indicator to the character development of the two travellers. The descriptions of Eden too, immediately afterwards, are haunting, and expressive. It is clear from a letter he wrote to his mentor and biographer, John Forster, about the mountains near Pittsburgh which he saw from a train when travelling through the area, that they are drawn from life. Forster himself called that area “The Original of Eden”. In addition, the scams to do with selling property - or selling shares in railways - or insurance fiddles - were all very common at the time. The novel's full name is,“TheLife and Adventures of Martin ChuzzlewitHis relatives, friends, and enemies. Comprising all His Wills and His Ways,With an Historical record of what he didand what he didn't;Shewing moreover who inherited the Family Plate,who came in for the Silver spoons,and who for the Wooden Ladles. The whole forming a complete keyto the House of Chuzzlewit.”  - a typically lengthy Victorian title - and in fact each of the 54 chapters has an equally long and informative preamble of a title. One would assume this made it easier to identify the protagonist, but this is not so.A modern interpretation of this novel would probably focus on the coming-of-age journey of a young man. Young Martin Chuzzlewit starts out as an unlikeable, selfish, arrogant young cad, who thinks the world owes him a living. The novel details all the experiences he goes through as he matures; life-threatening experiences which teach him a lesson and make him a far better person. So it is about a young man’s personal and moral development, just as the earlier novel “Nicholas Nickleby” had been. It also conforms to the ancient traditional story of the hero's journey. When we think of Martin Chuzzlewit, the novel, it is this particular young man whom we naturally think of. Yet the plural use of “Wills” in the title does not then make sense, for young Martin did not have a will in the legal sense of the word, and as we have learned, there is another, older Martin, his father. Thus it can be said to have developed a double meaning, reflecting the changing perspective of the author as the writing proceeded. It is partly about the transformation of the self-concern of the younger Martin into something more noble, and also about the selfishness of the older Martin, receiving help from an unexpected quarter, so that he too transforms into a worthy individual. Dickens loved to write about moral improvements; about people who genuinely strive to be better. So who is the hero? It is difficult to say. Possibly one of these two, or possibly Dickens’s original thought, Seth Pecksniff. It could even possibly be a character who is ever-present, and prominent in the frontispiece, playing his beloved church organ, with scenes and characters floating around him as thoughts in his mind as he plays, the noble but naïve Tom Pinch.It is a true masterpiece. Reading earlier novels, one can trace the origins of this one. The humour of “The Pickwick Papers” is tweaked to perfection. The brutality and bloody murder - and the subsequent horror felt by the murderer - are all there in prototype in “Oliver Twist”. Dickens had cautiously explored some romantic elements in “Nicholas Nickleby”, but here we have an abundance of three romances, amongst the young characters, plus a fourth very poignant romantic strand which runs through the entire novel. All are destined for happiness; Dickens loves to “reward” his good characters with a happy ending and his bad ones with their comeuppance and an appropriate punishment. We are anticipating both good and bad endings, even though we cannot predict them, throughout the book.And the bad endings? Oh my goodness. There are foul deeds and a murder described so powerfully that it may well cause shivers of revulsion and terror. Some of Dickens’s finest writing to date accompanies this event, with an evocative vivid description of a storm, lightning and dashing rain accompanying the episode. If you thrilled to (view spoiler)[Nancy’s murder (hide spoiler)] in “Oliver Twist”, you will be swept up in the horror of this. The perpetrator is very reminiscent of (view spoiler)[Bill Sikes (hide spoiler)].There are disguises, there are doubles, subterfuges and bluffs. There is mystery, confusion and duplicity, as in both “Nicholas Nickleby” and "Barnaby Rudge”. Things, and characters, are not always what they seem. Dickens is an adept at this, carefully referring to “The Man” or “The Stranger” so as not to give the game away. Dramatisations always miss this aspect, of course, as they do the evocative imagery. Read the book! Yet even now Dickens had not yet written his truly great novels; they were yet to come. But in my view this represents a growth on the part of the author. Dickens was planning a small book for the Christmas season of 1843 - one which would continue the theme of greed he was writing about in Martin Chuzzlewit. The result was a great classic, a favourite story loved by millions worldwide. It was published in December 1843, before the concluding episodes of Martin Chuzzlewit had even been published. And its name? It was “A Christmas Carol”. From then on, there was no stopping Mr. Charles Dickens.

      Dombey and Son

	1.Dombey and Son is a novel about pride and ambition. Paul Dombey, proud, wealthy, arrogant and frigid, is a man to whom the idea of "Dombey and Son" is paramount. There has always been a "Dombey and Son"; there will always be a "Dombey and Son". It is his whole world, his reason for being. Everything in his life is focused and directed towards this. The full title of the book is Dealings with the Firm of Dombey and Son: Wholesale, Retail and for Exportation. Therefore the "son" of the title, although a real living person, is first and foremost an abstract concept, much as we are led to believe Paul Dombey senior himself had been to his own father, and so on, as far back as living memory allowed."The earth was made for Dombey and Son to trade in, and the sun and moon were made to give them light ... Common abbreviations took new meanings in his eyes, and had sole reference to them. A. D. had no concern with Anno Domini, but stood for anno Dombei - and Son."The book starts with a defence of this character by Dickens himself, as part of the Preface from 1867, where he berates his earlier readers for "the confounding of shyness with arrogance", insisting that, "Mr Dombey undergoes no violent change, either in this book, or in real life. A sense of his injustice is within him, all along. The more he represses it, the more unjust he necessarily is." And although we despise Dombey Senior for his rigidity, his cold aloofness, his arrogance and pride, we see that he is the product of his class and time, and that any adapting of that initial "repression" as Dickens terms it, must represent a huge development in his character. This novel is partly about his eventual realisation and breaking out from such an inflexible mould. Dickens carefully inches Dombey along to more and more appallingly selfish acts, so that the reader comes to abominate the man's actions. Throughout he stays completely authentic and believable, even though at root Dombey is an honourable man. He is never a villain in the same mould as, for instance, his man of business the marvellously devious, scheming and manipulative wolf, Carker.Once again we have a myriad of wonderful characters. James Carker is a moral thug who steals every scene in which he appears. He would shoot to the top of the tree of pantomime villains; a delight to read about with his, "two unbroken rows of glistening teeth, whose regularity and whiteness were quite distressing. It was impossible to escape the observation of them, for he showed them whenever he spoke; and bore so wide a smile upon his countenance (a smile, however, very rarely, indeed, extending beyond his mouth), that there was something in it like the snarl of a cat."Carker's beauteous teeth are mentioned no less than 69 times in the novel!Dombey's little son Paul is, to use an expression of the the time, a strange old-fashioned boy. Dickens modelled him on his sister Fanny's crippled son Henry Burnett Junior. Paul's startling observations seem to indicate a wisdom, and perhaps a prescience, beyond his years. Coupled with his frailty, this increases our feelings of impending doom. Dombey also has a daughter, Florence, whom he ignores and despises. Her depiction is easily the most convincing "good" heroine he has created so far. She is virtuous, intelligent, hardworking, determined, modest and kind. In fact she has all the attributes Dickens admired in women. Yet unlike earlier female characters, she has what we would consider a "flaw". She feels guilt where there could not possibly be any. From a modern perspective then, she is very appealing. We do not like perfection. Another character who appears later in the book is Edith Granger, a proud, bridling, passionate but penniless widow, and again, she is a very rounded and complex character, with nuances of ambition, confusion, bitterness, loathing and a kind of desperate love. Almost as many pages of this novel are devoted to female characters as to male characters, including the title character, Dombey himself. Florence and Edith together comprise much of this attention. Edith's mother Mrs. Skewton is a wonderfully monstrous creation, a sort of prototype for the much later Miss Havisham in "Great Expectations". But unlike her, she pimps out her daughter while she primps up herself.As well as the great family of Dombey, there are other families whose kindness and warmth of their internal relationships provide a sharp contrast. There is young, good-hearted Walter Gay, his old salt-of-the-earth uncle Solomon Gills, a ship's instrument-maker, plus their friend the genial old Captain Cuttle. Captain Cuttle himself has an old seafaring friend called Captain Jack Bunsby, who is always called on in times of crisis for much-valued advice, although those around usually find such advice perplexing. Bunsby is hilariously described by Dickens as having,"one stationary eye in the mahogany face, and one revolving one, on the principle of some lighthouses."One cannot think of this family without thinking of Mrs. MacStinger, that fearsome harridan of a landlady, who terrifies the life out of Bunsby. The playing-out and denouement of their continuing saga, is both hilarious and satisfying, as it eventually weaves into another main theme. The strands in this novel are so subtly intertwined; the novel is superbly constructed. This family represent to some extent the old world which is being left behind. The Toodle family, rosy-cheeked Polly - who has to become "Mrs Richards" in order to emphasise her position as nurse rather than her individuality, her "plump and apple-faced" husband, who later begins to work on the railway, plus all the little Toodles including their eldest rogue of a son Rob (the Grinder) represent the new world. There is Dombey's sister Louisa Chick, the only person to have any influence whatsoever over him, slight though it is, and whose byword seems to be "effort". Anything could be overcome by more effort. According to her, the fact that Dombey's first wife died during childbirth (at the beginning of the novel) - was due to her "not making an effort" - thus proving without a doubt that she was not a real Dombey, with the admirable Dombey marks of character. There is Susan Nipper, initially an unpleasant and objectionable, waspish, sharp-tongued character, but as Florence's maid she proves to be a loyal and stout-hearted friend, who has the reader cheering from the sidelines when she tells some home truths to Paul Dombey. There is the gouty retired Major Joe Bagstock, put in for comic relief, as the objects of his amorous inclinations seem to change so very easily. Lucretia Tox too, switches her matrimonial attentions with equal alacrity - to our great entertainment once again. Another entertaining cameo role is played by Mrs Pipchin, the cantankerous operator of a boarding house in Brighton where Paul and Florence are sent for Paul's health. Never a comment goes by without her referring to her late husband, who had been killed 40 years earlier, in the Peruvian Mines. Dickens apparently modelled Mrs Pipchin on Mrs Roylance, who had been his landlady in London when his father was imprisoned for debt.There is the grotesque witch "Good" Mrs Brown, in a frightening and shocking fairytale passage in the book which is extraordinarily redolent of "Hansel and Gretel" or "Baba Yaga". Incredibly unpleasant and bizarre, she is one of the few actual caricatures in the book. Yet she returns later on, more fully fleshed out, and is revealed to have a profound connection to the main storyline. There is the portly scholar Doctor Blimbers, his wife who, "was not learned herself, but she pretended to be, and that did quite as well" and the Doctor's daughter, the ghoulish Cornelia, "dry and sandy with working in the graves of deceased languages". Kind but misguided, their strenuous disciplined instructive routine in their cramming Academy causes their little pupils such long-term distress. Minor characters add to the book's enjoyment. There is Toots, little Paul's scatterbrained classmate, who becomes the humble admirer of Florence, permanently worried about his absent-mindedness and addled brain. There are many more quirky characters dotted around the novel, and several subplots, such as the hidden mysterious secret between the Carker brothers. Why is Carker's older brother John called "the Junior" by James, having a low position at the firm of Dombey and Son, and why is he looked upon generally with scorn? There is the sister of both brothers, Harriet, who for some unknown reason has elected to live with this less successful brother, John. Then there is the feisty, aggressively enigmatic Alice Brown - what is her secret? There is the good-natured aristocrat cousin Feenix, who makes everything all right in the end, Doctor Parker Peps, Sir Barnet, Lady and Master Skettles and the wonderfully named Reverend Melchisedech Howler. There are many more characters who come to mind, but I cannot leave the topic without mentioning Florence's only true friend and sole companion at one point, a scruffy mutt, Diogenes the dog, "Come, then, Di! Dear Di! Make friends with your new mistress. Let us love each other, Di!' said Florence, fondling his shaggy head. And Di, the rough and gruff, as if his hairy hide were pervious to the tear that dropped upon it, and his dog's heart melted as it fell, put his nose up to her face, and swore fidelity ... Diogenes already loved her for her own, and didn't care how much he showed it. So he made himself vastly ridiculous by performing a variety of uncouth bounces in the ante-chamber, and concluded, when poor Florence was at last asleep, and dreaming of the rosy children opposite, by scratching open her bedroom door: rolling up his bed into a pillow: lying down on the boards, at the full length of his tether, with his head towards her: and looking lazily at her, upside down, out of the tops of his eyes, until from winking and winking he fell asleep himself, and dreamed, with gruff barks, of his enemy."We have this absurdity, this humour. We have our entertainment, our mystery - and sometime our horror. And we also have, perhaps for the first time, literary gravitas. For instance, the motif of Time constantly rears its head, with timepieces, clocks and watches, all present at decisive moments of the story. Another noticable device is the sea, waves, and running water. A sense of "waves", or a kind of unsteadiness often seeps into the story just as a character is delerious or beginning to be seriously ill, when an enormous eventful change is in the air, or some thing or idea is to be swept away. There is so much symbolism with ringing and bells tolling the death knell. There are both overt and subtle references to earlier literary works. Is it not deliberate that Dickens has created three witches in the novel? First comes the kidnapper and thief, the ogress "Good" Mrs Brown. The second is the abominable Mrs Skewton, whom Dickens facetiously refers to throughout as "Cleopatra" because of her artificiality. This description is of her as her maid attends to Mrs. Skewton's dress as she retires at night,"... her touch was as the touch of Death. The painted object shrivelled underneath her hand; the form collapsed, the hair dropped off, the arched dark eyebrows changed to scanty tufts of grey; the pale lips shrunk, the skin became cadaverous and loose, an old, worn yellow, nodding woman, with red eyes, alone remained in Cleopatra's place, huddled up, like a slovenly bundle, in a greasy flannel gown." What an eye! The third hag, is a fortune-teller, or tramp, "a withered and very ugly old woman ... munching with her jaws, as if the Death's Head beneath her yellow skin were impatient to get out". Scowling, screaming, wrathful, and "going backwards like a crab, or like a heap of crabs: for her alternately expanding and contracting hands might have represented two of that species, and her creeping face some half-a-dozen more: crouched on the veinous root of an old tree, pulled out a short black pipe from within the crown of her bonnet, lighted it with a match, and smoked in silence, looking fixedly at her questioner." This narrative complexity marks a subtle change and expertise in Dickens's novel-writing. Dombey and Son is a book which can be read on many levels. During 1844 to 1847, the railways were starting to be developed, and the impact this has on London life is also a major aspect of the book. Several of the characters can been seen as representing one age or another. Dombey epitomises the older age of traditional values, stymied by the new exciting upcoming age which was to clear away the stuffiness with more opportunities for all. Yet this new age was also to impose mechanisation and a lack of individuality. Dickens sees it all, and see the faults inherent in both. His powerful descriptive passages describing the coming of the railroad to Camden Town, conjure up a hellish place,""The first shock of a great earthquake had, just at that period, rent the whole neighbourhood to its centre. Traces of its course were visible on every side. Houses were knocked down; streets broken through and stopped; deep pits and trenches dug in the ground; enormous heaps of earth and clay thrown up; buildings that were undermined and shaking, propped by great beams of wood ... Hot springs and fiery eruptions, the usual attendants upon earthquakes, lent their contributions of confusion to the scene. Boiling water hissed and heaved within dilapidated walls; whence, also, the glare and roar of flames came issuing forth; and mounds of ashes blocked up rights of way"Dombey and Son was Charles Dickens's seventh novel, published, as his earlier ones had been, in monthly parts initially, between Oct 1846 and Apr 1848. He was between 34 and 36 years old when he wrote it. The first parts were written in Lausanne, Switzerland, before Dickens returned to England, via Paris, to complete it. He also published one of his Christmas books, "The Battle Of Life", was directing and acting in various theatrical productions, and set up "Urania Cottage" (for "fallen women") with his friend the philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts, all within the space of time when he was writing Dombey and Son. As always, he was a literary dynamo, pushing himself to the absolute maximum.Dickens asked his great friend, Hablot K. Browne, or "Phiz" to illustrate Dombey and Son. He was not sure how it would sell, as he had new publishers, Bradbury and Evans. As it turned out, he had been worrying quite needlessly. Before long the installments were selling at up to 40,000 copies a month. This was eight times as many as his main competitor, William Makepeace Thackeray, whose monthly installments of Vanity Fair were being issued by the same publisher, but only selling only 5000 copies a month at the most. Interestingly Vanity Fair is probably the more popular novel of the two nowadays. This is yet another example of how immensely popular Dickens was. He really could do no wrong in the public's eye.Whenever considering a novel by Dickens it is always as well to bear in mind that what we now read in one book, was never read this way by the initial audience. It is serial fiction, and the structure has to take this into account. Those earlier readers may have forgotten a character or episode; equally, they may need a very dramatic or comic interlude to sustain their interest for the month ahead. This sort of imposed spasmodic reading is mostly alien to us now. Having said that, the writing is masterly. Dickens now has a much surer touch when describing his characters. Unlike Thackeray's or Trollope's, they range throughout the upper and lower classes, so that the reader gains a very clear picture of society in his time. There are fewer outright caricatures, but many outrageously funny ones. The female characters have far more depth than ever before, and the novel is devoted proportionally far more towards female characters.Critics consider Dombey and Son to be Dickens's first artistically mature work. After this novel was published, his reputation had grown so much that he was by then considered a world class author. This is the first one for which he planned properly with notes to outline how the novel would progress. He called these notes "mems". All Dickens's novels up to this point had been created free-form, from a germ of a suggestion. Frequently they developed into something different from what the author originally had in mind, yet all are inspired pieces of writing. It would be hard to say when Dickens first started to conform to what we now think of as a novelist, rather than an observant recorder of life, taking his inspiration from the notes he made on what happens in the street, brilliantly embellishing them and throwing in a few sarcastic diatribes on the way. Mental giant though he undoubtably was, his writing often strikes the readers as a series of momentary farces. With Dombey and Son Dickens had made it clear in his letters to his friend and mentor John Forster, that he had resolved to be a serious novelist. This novel is more consistent, and has a sounder structure, with less discursiveness in the middle seeming to go nowhere. It has themes and subplots to which he returns again and again. It has pathos which has more emotional appeal than before; nothing seems quite so frivolous. "Nicholas Nickleby" had represented Dickens's first attempt at a true novel. In that there is the unforgettable portrayal of a school, "Dotheboys Hall" with its ogre of a headmaster Mr. Squeers. Yet that part of the book is merely an episode, albeit an inspired, hilarious, scandalous, hugely entertaining episode. Nothing which happens there affects the main character very much. On the contrary, the character Nicholas Nickleby seems to exist merely in order to tell us about Dotheboys Hall. But when little Paul Dombey goes to Dr. Blimber's, we get a real sense of the characters there, the kindly but old-fashioned cramming teachers. Little Paul's pathos is highlighted not by extreme contrast with some exaggerated cartoon character, but by contrast with old dusty pedantry. There is a real sense of predestination and tragedy throughout. Paul's childish innocence and extraordinary wisdom is eventually perceived and appreciated by all, and his departure from that school is one of the most affecting parts of the book. Dombey and Son has all the satirical indignation readers relish so in his early novels, but it has new shades of darkness and a new narrative complexity. There are so many nuances and grim metaphors. To take a tiny example, think of the loss of the Walter's ship "The Son and Heir", and think of an alternative applied meaning. After Dombey and Son were to come Dickens's greatest novels. These are darker still, and even his absurdity was to be more grave. I did not weep for Little Nell, in "The Old Curiosity Shop", but I wept for little Paul, that wise child, with a philosophical air lifting him preternaturally out of his small body. I was in good company. When that episode was first published, the entire nation of England was apparently prostrated by grief. William Thackeray, in the middle of serialising his own novel, "Vanity Fair", was consumed with envy, expostulating,“There’s no writing against such power as this - one has no chance!”And that in itself, is a measure to me, of just how far Dickens's writing has by now gained in mastery and stature.
	2.I find it hard to describe my love of this book. This is my fourth or fifth reading and I absolutely loved it - it's incredibly powerful, such a compelling and interesting story, with such brilliant explorations of grief, love, family, gender and Victorian marriage. It's a very underrated Dickens and a real gem - I highly recommend!

	1.Barnaby Rudge, Charles DickensBarnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of Eighty (commonly known as Barnaby Rudge) is a historical novel by British novelist Charles Dickens. It was Dickens' first historical novel. His only other is the much later A Tale of Two Cities, also set in revolutionary times. It is one of his less popular novels and has rarely been adapted for film or television.Gathered around the fire at the Maypole Inn, in the village of Chigwell, on an evening of foul weather in the year 1775, are John Willet, proprietor of the Maypole, and his three cronies. One of the three, Solomon Daisy, tells an ill-kempt stranger at the inn a well-known local tale of the murder of Reuben Haredale which had occurred 22 years earlier on that very day. Reuben had been the owner of the Warren, a local estate which is now the residence of Geoffrey, the deceased Reuben's brother, and Geoffrey's niece, Reuben's daughter Emma Haredale. After the murder, Reuben's gardener and steward went missing and were suspects in the crime. A body was later found and identified as that of the steward, so the gardener was assumed to be the murderer. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوازدهم ماه نوامبر سال 1997میلادیعنوان: بارنابی روج در دو جلد؛ نویسنده: چارلز دیکنز؛ مترجم: محمد مجلسی؛ تهران، نشر دنیای نو، 1374، در دوجلد، و در 1115ص؛ شابک جلد یک 9646564844؛ شابک جلد دو 9646564852 موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیایی - سده 19 مآقای «هاردال» ملکداری بزرگ است، که برادرش، و پیشکار او، سالها پیش به قتل رسیده اند، و راز قتل آنها هنوز آشکار نشده است، دختر زیبای برادرش «اما» نیز با او زندگی میکند؛ دختر عاشق «ادوارد» است، ولی پدر «ادوارد» و عموی «اما»، دشمن یکدیگرند، و ...؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 21/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی

His penultimate novel, it was written 18 years later, and has a very different tone with little humour. But Dickens's classic wit, his irony and eye for the absurd are what many people love about his writing. And Barnaby Rudge has these in abundance. So it is all the more puzzling that it is read so infrequently.The scenes where Gabriel Varden's hypocritical and supposedly long-suffering martyr of a wife is aided and abetted by their sly, vituperous servant Miggs against the exasperated locksmith, are some of the funniest anywhere in Dickens, who says her moodiness could be the result of being spoiled by wealth,  "Mrs Varden expressed her belief that never was any woman so beset as she; that her life was a continued scene of trial; that whenever she was disposed to be well and cheerful, so sure were the people around her to throw, by some means or other, a damp upon her spirits; and that, as she had enjoyed herself that day, and Heaven knew it was very seldom she did enjoy herself so she was now to pay the penalty."Their preening peacock of an apprentice Sim Tappertit, complete with his powerful eye and his beautiful legs, (though very short) comes a very close second. He is the "noble captain" and leader of a risible secret society of 'Prentice Knights. Yet everyone knows what a prize idiot he really is, as the blind man Stagg remarks as an aside,"Good luck go with you for a - conceited, bragging, empty-headed, duck-legged idiot"The ponderous publican Joe Willett, with his slow-witted homespun philosophies is an easy third, ruminating, "According to the constitution of mermaids, so much of a mermaid as is not a woman must be a fish"So many characters in this novel make us smile with their eccentricities; easily as many as in any of his novels to date. Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of Eighty was intended to be his first serious work of literature, inspired by Sir Walter Scott's historical novels, such as The Waverley Novels, and "Ivanhoe". Yet Dickens just could not resist creating these absurd characters whom his readers chuckle over and love so much. The most unusual "character" is Grip - and he is certainly a character, although he also happens to be Barnaby Rudge's pet raven! He is self-willed, displays eccentric behaviour, and has learned a whole catalogue of phrases, his favourite being a variety of ways of saying, "Polly Put the Kettle On". He is a gift of a character to an absurdist like Dickens. The reader may well find themselves laughing out loud at the inappropriate contributions Grip makes.It is not surprising that Dickens shows a keen eye for observing the raven's behaviour. He explains in his preface that Grip is based on a pet raven he himself had had, called Grip. It wasn't his first, but it was the one he loved most. His own raven died in March 1841 - ironically and sadly in the middle of Dickens writing this novel - from eating lead chips. Dickens had it stuffed, copying George IV who had had his pet giraffe stuffed. It is still on public view, incidentally, in a museum in Philadelphia. Grip was also the inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe's most famous poem, "The Raven". Poe admired Dickens, and paid tribute to Grip in a review of Barnaby Rudge which he wrote for a magazine, saying that the raven should have served "a more symbolic prophetic purpose". This is Dickens's fifth novel, written when he was 29 years of age, and published in weekly instalments between February and November 1841. By now he had become everybody's darling, with a public dinner being held in his honour in Edinburgh. He had originally signed a contract in 1836 to write a book entitled "Gabriel Varden - The Locksmith of London", for "Bentley's Miscellany" but after becoming more successful, and falling out with Bentley, he bought back the contract and the novel was subsequently published by Chapman and Hall in "Master Humphrey's Clock", and illustrated by two of his regular favourites, Phiz and George Cattermole. Many of his letters to these two artists survive, and it is remarkable how extraordinarily detailed and specific the descriptions are, for the engravings Dickens wished the artists to make. He evidently had a mental picture of a scene as it might be enacted on stage, and made sure he stayed in charge of the creative process for every single step of the way - including each illustration. A hard task-master indeed.The first half of the novel is set in the time leading up to the Gordon Riots in London in 1780. 1778 saw the Catholic Relief Act, allowing Roman Catholics to own property, inherit land, and join the army, all of which had been formerly forbidden to them. They also became able to vote if they owned land. This is the underlying scenario to the novel; the times were wrought with tensions and uncertainty. The novel starts in the "Maypole Inn" in Chigwell, in an area of Essex notorious for its highwaymen, "The Maypole was an old building, with more gable ends than a man would care to count on a sunny day. ... It was a hale and hearty age though, still: and in the summer or autumn evenings, when the glow of the setting sun fell upon the oak and chestnut trees of the adjacent forest, the old house, partaking of its lustre, seemed their fit companion, and to have many good years of life in him yet."Interestingly this pub, of the first illustration, still stands today. Built in 1547, it is one of the oldest public houses in England, just a few miles down the road from this reviewer. It is this first half which is so entertaining in true Dickensian fashion. But the description above belies the dark, brooding atmosphere conjured up. Right at the start we have an unresolved mystery. It is a grisly and ghostly tale; a long involved story of murder and intrigue, told by by Dickens's mouthpiece, old Solomon Daisy. This character is well-named to give the reader a clear indication of the foreboding in this novel, describing as he does the "Solemn Day" of the double murder. Enticingly he says,"I have heard it said that as we keep our birthdays when we are alive, so the ghosts of dead people, who are not easy in their graves, keep the day they died upon"Solomon Daisy is one of a group of eccentric old-timers clustered round the Maypole's pub fire in the depths of Winter. These scenes are steeped in atmosphere; a cold, dark winter's evening, a group of locals enjoying a glass of punch, listening to tall stories accompanied by the crackle of the fire, and watching the smoke curling upwards from their long-stemmed pipes. Dickens conjures up a feeling of sitting right there with the characters. Among this group's cosy spot amidst the mists and unknown terrors outside, a mysterious traveller arrives, followed by another more threatening stranger, who is also shrouded in mystery.This is followed by invigorating horsechases in the pitch black across the treacherous highwayman-infested wilds of Essex. There is an attack, a young gentleman set upon in the dark by unknown foes. Throughout permeates a feeling of unease and change, a brewing of disturbance, brimming just under the surface. There are also various tensions between fathers and sons, employers and workers. One concerns two feuding families, the Chesters and the Haredales, who are reminiscent of Shakespeare's Montagues and Capulets. The suave, charming snake, Sir Edward Chester, is a Protestant. Despite his dissimulation he is ruthlessly manipulative; both his physical appearance, expressive language and behaviour all providing a contrast to the the bluff impatient Haredale, who is a Catholic. Friction sparks. But is the deep enmity really a result of religious differences? Or is there also an underlying sinister element? Their enmity dates from childhood. We are beginning to see that many events from the past may haunt this novel. Interestingly, Edward Chester is based on Philip Dormer Stanhope, the 4th Earl of Chesterfield, whose complimenting manners, urbanity, and witticisms were highly regarded. But he made an enemy of Samuel Johnson (of the dictionary) who described Lord Chesterfield's published letters to his son as,"selfish, calculating and contemptuous; he was not naturally generous, and he practised dissimulation until it became part of his nature ... they teach the morals of a whore, and the manners of a dancing-master"Dickens's character Edward Chester himself quotes from Lord Chesterfield's letters. Dickens describes him as,"of the world most worldly, who never compromised himself by an ungentlemanly action and was never guilty of a manly one" As well as the tension between families, we have many episodes of comic domestic disharmony, and budding romances. There is Dolly Varden, a vain coquette of a minx, with whom Dickens was clearly besotted! When ostensibly comforting her friend Emma Haredale, "Dolly's eyes, by one of those strange accidents for which there is no accounting, wandered to the glass again" ..."To make one's sweetheart miserable is well enough and quite right, but to be made miserable one's self is a little too much!"Dickens shows us he has a keen eye for the folly and the vanity of youth. Yet the reader now fully expects that love will not run smoothly. In Dickens there is never any moral ambiguity. Characters either develop and learn from their mistakes, or they do not. And those who do not will usually meet a sorry end, or their just desserts, in one way or another. By the middle of the novel the reader may well be puzzled as to its name. There is a multilayered medley of themes, yet the title's subheading, "A Tale of the Riots of Eighty" seems to be inexplicable. And the character of Barnaby Rudge pops in and out of the story seemingly on a whim. This is not a bildungsroman in any sense, neither is it picaresque. It does not even proceed in a similar vein to that of the history of Oliver Twist or Nicholas Nickleby. Barnaby Rudge is a simple soul, often referred to by himself as "silly" and by his neighbours, though kindly, as an idiot. He loves Nature, has a close relationship with his raven, and has dreams of making his fortune to help his mother. We suspect a back history with Barnaby, and we are not disappointed.There is a change of direction in the second half, and Barnaby becomes involved with a new set of characters. There is Lord George Gordon, who is presented here as a well-meaning but deluded fool, goaded by his dubious henchmen into increasingly bold measures leading the Protestant Association, and openly opposing the Catholic Relief Act, demanding its withdrawal. The villain of the piece is his secretary, the cold, calculating and conniving Gashford, whom Dickens unequivocally describes as, "singularly repulsive and malicious"He is based on Robert Watson, a real life friend of Gordon, who wrote a history of the Riots in 1795. Later Robert Watson committed suicide and about nineteen scars were found on his body. This is believed to be the reason why Dickens called his character "Gashford". In the novel, Gashford muses,"More seed, more seed ... When will the harvest come?"as he plots and casts his net to entrap more supporters to the Protestant Cause, and hence more victims. He deliberately incites rioting and rebel-rousing, and his advice to Lord George Gordon is always intended to cause as much chaos, brutality and disturbance as possible. Another evil character who does not have the ability to employ such machinations is the self-seeking hangman Dennis. The solid John Grueby seems to be Gordon's only true friend. He is loyal to his master, and basically a good-hearted man, but he abhors the violence he can see resulting from the situation Gordon has allowed himself to be duped into. The reader too, knows from the start that events are going to escalate terrifyingly. There is betrayal, duplicity and changing of sides; an increase in the tension and a definite switch in the writing of this second half, much of which is very savage.References are made to "Bloody Mary", the daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, who had briefly reigned as Mary I from 1553-1558. During this time she had tried to re-establish the the Catholic faith of her mother, often by barbaric means, hence her name. The atrocities committed against Protestants during her reign became a rallying cry of the Protestant mob during the Gordon Riots. On June 2, 1780 the Protestant Association marched to the House of Commons and were joined by a riotous mob of 50,000. Dickens described them as,"sprinkled doubtless here and there with honest zealots, but composed for the most part of the very scum and refuse of London"He describes in great detail how the crowd were whipped up into a frenzy. His descriptions are incredibly powerful and visual, some parts having the graphic and explicit detail to make the reader's hair stand on end, being more usually found in a horror novel than a classic by Dickens. The tension and horror build relentlessly. In real life for the next few days the mob terrorized London, burning Catholic churches, and the businesses and homes of Catholic families. Dickens describes all the events; how they burned down Newgate Prison, The Fleet, and King's Bench Prisons. He describes the terror of the prisoners, the deaths of innocent bystanders, how everyone was inadvertently caught up in the deathly smoke, the fire and the rabble, and how the prisoners - some incarcerated for negligible crimes - were set free, running amok without hope, bewildered, confused, damaged and burnt, with nowhere to run to,"There were some broken men among these debtors who had been in jail so long, and were so miserable and destitute of friends, so dead to the world, and utterly forgotten and uncared for, that they implored their jailers not to set them free"The Lord Mayor, whom Dickens based on Brackley Kennett, Lord Mayor of London from 1779-1780, did nothing when appealed to by characters in the novel. In real life Kennett was later convicted of criminal negligence for his conduct during the Riots. They then appeal to the magistrate Sir John Fielding, who was the younger half-brother of the novelist Henry Fielding. Both brothers worked towards criminal reform and John Fielding, who was blind and earned the nickname of "The Blind Beak" was the founder of the "Bow Street Runners" first police force.Nevertheless, Dickens had a clear grasp of mob mentality, "The crowd was the law and never was the law held in greater dread, or more implicitly obeyed."Eventually George III ordered his troops to quell the riots. The mob was read the Riot Act; an Act of Parliament from 1714, which forced riotous crowds to disperse within one hour after the reading of the Act, or risk being shot. In actuality nearly 300 rioters were killed, and 450 were taken prisoner. 25 were hanged. Lord George Gordon, held in the Tower of London, was tried and found not guilty of treason. The reader follows the progress of Barnaby Rudge, who has been caught up in the riots, and Hugh the Hostler from the Maypole Inn. Hugh was based on the real life James Jackson, who was a watch-wheel cutter and according to reports of the time, a "very desperate fellow" whose voice "boomed like the crack of doom". In the novel he is angling for any trouble, in one scene not even getting the anti-Catholic slogan "No Popery!" right, shouting "No Property!"We read with horror as some of the pleasant pastoral scenes in the beginning of the novel are wrecked, and amiable characters savagely treated, never to return to their old trusting ways. In the end Dickens makes sure that those who have perpetrated evil acts get their comeuppance, and their punishment is largely commensurate with the enormity of their crime. Some are hanged. Others, whose crime was lesser, are given a lesser punishment, such as (view spoiler)[the apprentice Simon Tappertit. Dickens had spent a great deal of time early in the novel commenting on Sims' beautiful legs, often in a satirical tone; they are a metaphor for his bragging ambitions. The suggestion is that the weakness of his legs will never bring Sim the accolades and status he desires. Sim's punishment is to lose his precious legs, so that he is destined for life in the gutter. Only his old friend and employer Gabriel Varden saves him from this. But in an enormous stroke of irony Dickens makes him become a shoeblack, so he lost his beautiful legs, only to be confronted with others' legs on a daily basis. Another, the abominable Miggs, possibly the most vituperous female in all Dickens's novels, appropriately ends up in a women's prison, albeit as a turnkey rather than an inmate. (hide spoiler)]Towards the end of Barnaby Rudge Dickens describes the public executions of characters in the book, which were performed at Newgate prison. Dickens hated such public displays, intended to be an extra deterrent to crime, but often taking on a circus atmosphere. He had reported his reaction to an execution in 1849 in a letter to "The Times". Writing these parts, Dickens had been in Broadstairs for two months, but by October he was having painful surgery for a fistula, and having to convalesce for a month. Nevertheless his biographer John Forster notes that Dickens was determined to complete the novel in the expected time.So why the change of name from "Gabriel Varden - The Locksmith of London"? Gabriel Varden is without doubt a stalwart character, worthy of being the novel's hero in preference to the whimsical portrait of Barnaby Rudge. He is more in evidence throughout the novel, rather than disappearing for long stretches. But by retitling the novel, rather than including any more scenes about him Dickens has made his readers focus more on Barnaby Rudge. And the choice of a simple-minded man for his focus character is inspired.It points up the ridiculousness of the situation itself. Not only has Lord George Gordon, the deranged leader of the rioters, been sadly misinformed by his henchmen, but (view spoiler)[he puts what he calls a "natural" at the head of the riots, standing guard over the treasure, ready to carry the can for all misdemeanours. And Grip of course provides a perfect foil for him to pour his heart out to - all his steadfastness, determination and hopes of making his mother proud of him. Towards the end of the novel, when Barnaby has been condemned, it seems inevitable that he will be hanged. The scenes of Barnaby and Grip in Newgate prison, (hide spoiler)] make the reader want to weep for the deliberate manipulation and contrived destruction of such innocent joy in life. The descriptions of the riots are so powerful and intense. Yet his quirky humour is present too, in the detail; all the eccentric characters and environments. There is possibly no other author who can combine such opposing themes quite so well.The Gordon Riots do not have a "hook" such as the infamy and grisly romance of the French Revolution, which could explain why this novel is so neglected. Dickens had not yet reached the pinnacle of his writing, and was yet to write his truly great novels. But this one has none of the hyperbole of the earlier ones. It is still exuberant and comic in places, but the posturing and sarcasm which sometimes seem almost overwhelming in early novels such as "Oliver Twist" are far less in evidence. It is altogether more controlled, better planned and consequently a more powerful piece.And it is well worth reading!

reviews:
	1.The Chimes, or to give it its full title, The Chimes, a Goblin Story of Some Bells That Rang an Old Year Out and a New Year In, is the second Christmas book by Charles Dickens. It was written in 1844, a year after his phenomenally successful "A Christmas Carol", and continued the burgeoning tradition of an annual Christmas book in what he called the "Carol philosophy". He was to write five of these short novels, all of which have a strong social and moral message. He then discontinued them in favour of shorter stories with a Christmassy feel in his weekly magazines, "Household Words" (1850-1858) and "All the Year Round" (1859-1867). Eventually there were to be over twenty of these shorter pieces.The Chimes does not have quite the same London-based feel as many of Dickens's stories, and Dickens himself said that he missed having London as his inspiration. The idea for it came whilst he was spending a year in Italy, with his wife Kate, their five children, Kate's sister Georgina, and all their servants. Soon after they arrived in Genoa, Dickens became aware of the incessant ringing of the church bells. His biographer Forster recorded Dickens having said that in writing The Chimes he was, "striking a blow for the poor". When he had completed the novel, he rushed back to England, to read it to Forster and his other friends, and organise publication before returning to his family in Genoa just before Christmas 1844.Dickens had great hopes of The Chimes, and employed four artists to provide illustrations, even though the work is so short. This confident extract is from a letter to his wife,"The little book is now, as far as I am concerned, all ready. One cut of Doyle's and one of Leech's I found so unlike my ideas, that I had them both to breakfast with me this morning, and with that winning manner which you know of, got them with the highest good humour to do both afresh. They are now hard at it. Stanfield's readiness, delight, wonder at my being pleased with what he has done is delicious. Mac's frontispiece is charming. The book is quite splendid; the expenses will be very great, I have no doubt."There are several parallels to be drawn with "A Christmas Carol" in this novel. Just as the earlier story is about Scrooge learning a lesson in humanity from the spirits, The Chimes also has a character for the reader to focus on, Toby or "Trotty" Veck. Trotty works as a ticket-porter, waiting all day outside the door of St. Malackey's bell tower for odd jobs. He is a poor, simple, "weak, small, spare old man". Yet it is Trotty Veck, with whom (unlike Ebenezer Scrooge) we have a lot of sympathy, who is to be taught a lesson. This time it is much harder to deduce what he can have done wrong. Trotty has a daughter, "Meg", whom he idolises. Dickens has created his favourite type of heroine here - young, virtuous, beautiful and kind. She has a sweetheart, a worthy blacksmith called Richard, and they want to marry. As Trotty patiently stands outside the church, musing on the bells and unnoticed by all the passers by, Dickens introduces us to the two young people, and we begin to get a picture of the dire poverty by which all subsist, and also the misgivings about the young couples' future which Trotty himself has.To pile on the pathos, we are introduced the pompous Alderman Cute, who thinks nothing of poking fun at Trotty's situation and stealing his scant food, as he shows off to his two companions, Mr. Filer, a rigid political economist and another overly nostalgic, "red-faced gentleman in a blue coat", who bemoans, "The good old times, the good old times ... what times they were!"The three continually "put down" the engaged couples' plan to marry, drumming into them how selfish and irresponsible it would be. "They have no earthly right or business to be married, ... they have no earthly right or business to be born!"says Alderman Cute. Here, from later in the story, is a barbed, cynical thumbnail sketch of his arrogance, imbued with true Dickensian sarcasm,"Seen the Alderman? Oh dear! Who could ever help seeing the Alderman. He was so considerate, so affable; he bore so much in mind the natural desires of folks to see him; that if he had a fault, it was the being constantly On View. And wherever the great people were, there, to be sure, attracted by the kindred sympathy between great souls, was Cute."Eventually, after all three poor folk have been castigated and made to feel even more wretched, Trotty is given a note to take to a local MP, Sir Joseph Bowley, who makes a great show of dispensing charity to the poor. As we meet Bowley, we become aware through Dickens's facetious portrayal, that he is cast in the same mould as the Alderman - that of a pontificating dictator. Bowley makes a point of chastising Trotty for his debts, whilst ostentatiously paying off his own debts before the new year, completely ignoring the fact that Trotty has no way of paying off what he owes to his local shop. He drums into Trotty his one great moral lesson, which he says the poor need to learn, "entire dependence on myself!" Trotty is in despair by this point,"No, no. We can't go right or do right ... There is no good in us. We are born bad!"The story has clearly indicated where our sympathies should lie, but just to hammer the point home, Dickens introduces two more characters in desperate need. They are Will Fern, a poor countryman, and his orphaned niece, Lilian. (view spoiler)[Because Trotty had overheard a conversation at Alderman Cute's house, he is able to warn Will that he is likely to be arrested and put in prison for vagrancy. (hide spoiler)]This is where the reader discovers what Trotty's lesson is to be. The bells of the church have always seemed to have a fascination for Trotty. Now one night, he feels as if they are calling him. He goes there, finds the church tower door unlocked and climbs up to the bellchamber. There follows one of Dickens's most whimsical atmospheric passages, describing the spirits' goblin helpers and then the spirits of the bells themselves,"swarming with dwarf phantoms, spirits, elfin creatures of the Bells ... He saw them ugly, handsome, crippled, exquisitely formed. He saw them young, he saw them old, he saw them kind, he saw them cruel, he saw them merry, he saw them grim; he saw them dance, and heard them sing; he saw them tear their hair, and heard them howl ... Mysterious and awful figures! Resting on nothing; poised in the night air of the tower, with their draped and hooded heads merged in the dim roof; motionless and shadowy. Shadowy and dark, although he saw them by some light belonging to themselves - none else was there - each with its muffled hand upon its goblin mouth."Trotty's "crime", he is told, is in not taking personal responsibility, in not having any inner convictions, and in losing confidence, faith in a higher power, and hope and determination that life would improve. He is reprimanded for his condemnation of people less fortunate than himself, offering them neither help nor pity. On his walk to Sir Joseph Bowley's house he had condemned a "cutpurse" (thief), and ignored the plight of a prostitute in the power of her pimp. He had read the account in a newspaper of a woman, driven from her home by poverty and misfortune, who had killed her child and herself. Trotty had seen this as final proof of the badness of the working class, and had cursed the woman as "unnatural and cruel". The goblins and spirits tell him that he has begun to emulate the behaviour of those such as Alderman Cute,"Who turns his back upon the fallen and disfigured of his kind; abandons them as vile; and does not trace and track with pitying eyes the unfenced precipice by which they fell from good - grasping in their fall some tufts and shreds of that lost soil, and clinging to them still when bruised and dying in the gulf below; does wrong to Heaven and man, to time and to eternity."He is also told to try to improve conditions in the here and now, not to sorrowfully remember a fictitiously "better" time in years past.Just as we have "staves" in "A Christmas Carol", The Chimes is divided into four parts entitled "quarters", after the quarter chimes of a striking clock. And just as in "A Christmas Carol", Ebenezer Scrooge learns his lesson from the spirits by being shown a series of visions, including images of what might be to come, Trotty Veck is now shown a series in the same vein; visions of what may be to come.These parts of the story are very downbeat. (view spoiler)[We learn the future troubled lives of Meg, Richard, Will and Lilian, who nine years later have all been driven beyond endurance. They have the friendship of Mrs. Chickenstalker, once a great friend to Toby, who is now married to Mr Tugsby, a general grocer. But despite their help, Richard becomes an alcoholic,"A slouching, moody, drunken sloven, wasted by intemperance and vice, and with his matted hair and unshorn beard in wild disorder; but, with some traces on him, too, of having been a man of good proportion and good features in his youth." and Meg becomes even more worn down. She eventually marries Richard, to try to rescue him, but he dies leaving her with a baby. Mrs Tugby laments their fate, although Dickens spouts the inevitability of it all through her,"I hoped that such prophecies as parted them when they were young, may not often fulfil themselves as they did in this case ..."Will Fern is in and out of prison, unable to abide by petty laws. He turns up during the annual New Year's Day Banquet and turns on Sir Joseph Bowley, hailed as "the Poor Man's Friend". Will gives an impassioned lengthy speech, detailing the unfairness and inevitability of his life, and against the treatment of the working classes,"To jail with him, for he's a vagrant, and a jail-bird known; and jail's the only home he's got ... don't set Jail, Jail, Jail 'afor us everywhere we turn." Lilian turns to prostitution, saying she can no longer, "... bear to live in such helpless, hopeless poverty." Eventually, suffering from tuberculosis and delirious, she dies in Meg's arms. And Meg, desperate and destitute, contemplates drowning herself and her child. She debates whether risking her soul would be better than the workhouse, which may be worse than death, but it would mean committing the dual sins of murder and suicide. Although the readers knows this is a dream, in this way Dickens has emphasised grim reality too, with the real-life case of the woman in the newspaper killing her baby. (hide spoiler)] Because of the length of time these episodes take, and the lack of a light touch - although there is much sarcasm and hyperbole - the novella becomes increasingly bleak and difficult to read.Like "A Christmas Carol", The Chimes was an immediate success. Almost 20,000 copies were sold in the first three months and within weeks of publication five different stage productions had been mounted. The critics were divided, as the social and political message was thought to be dangerously radical. Yet now, the only Christmas story by Dickens which captures the public's imagination year after year is its predecessor, the very first novel, "A Christmas Carol". The Chimes is not particularly well-known nowadays, except to Dickens enthusiasts. Why could that be? The early stories all "strike a sledgehammer blow", as Dickens put it, for the disadvantaged in society; for the poor, the uneducated and - particularly in The Chimes - the repressed. They all prick our consciences, at a time of year when more of us are likely to be approachable. All are full of drama, have elements of whimsy and humour, plus a satisfactorily happy ending, often with someone seeing the error of their ways, or learning a valuable moral lesson.Perhaps one difference might be that although this one has many of the same factors as "A Christmas Carol", it overplays the social problems more, and they are specific to the 1840's. Referred to as the "Hungry Forties" the 1840's were a time of great social and political unrest. This is a campaigning novel; a novel urging social change, as so many of Dickens's novels are. In addition to "A Christmas Carol" his early novels such as "Oliver Twist" are full of criticisms of Utilitarianism. According to Jeremy Bentham, man's actions were governed by the will to avoid pain and strive for pleasure, so the government's task was to increase the benefits of society by punishing and rewarding people according to their actions. In "Oliver Twist" it was clearly depicted that consequent institutions such as the workhouse led to denial of all civil liberties and any human dignity. In The Chimes, Dickens is taking to task the English cleric and scholar, the political economist Thomas Robert Malthus. Malthus disagreed with short-term expediency, fearing that there were no acceptable measures to population growth other than virtuous behaviour. Otherwise misery, starvation, disease and war were inevitable. He wrote, "The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man". The character of Mr. Filer is clearly a satirical view of Thomas Malthus. This is indicated by his constant spouting of statistics, and instances such as telling Richard he had no business to marry. Other characters are also satirical portrayals of other topical figures, who embodied political or philosophical ideas of the time. Dickens dwelt on their vices - the condescension and patronising attitude of Sir Joseph Bowley; the pomposity and high-handedness of Alderman Cute. Apparently Alderman Cute is a satirical portrait of Sir Peter Laurie, whom Dickens considered had a very dismissive attitude towards the poor people in London. Laurie had publicly denied that Jacob's Island existed at all, even though Dickens had written about the slum in "Oliver Twist". In the first cheap edition of the novel in 1850, Dickens wrote a new preface ridiculing Laurie's denial. However, these satirical representations of actual public figures are not at all recognisable today. We might recognise the types even now; the blustering and deeply hypocritical stances of various individuals in power at any one time. But we are not quite so aware of the particular parallels drawn. Neither are we so aware of the details of the political and social unrest of that era. One instance of this is when Will Fern, eaten up by hatred and a desire for revenge, promises, "there will be fires tonight". Here Dickens is referring to the rick burnings during riots by agricultural workers in the 1830's. "The Swing Riots", which started initially in Kent, were caused by the working class public perception of the new threshing machines putting people out of work. Rioters objected to the tithe system, the Poor Law guardians, and the rich tenant farmers who lowered wages whilst introducing agricultural machinery. But rioting could be punished by death. Only a present-day reader who is also an historian, may nowadays have the insight to easily pick up references such as this in The Chimes.Also, although both stories offer a hint of the supernatural, one seems less alien to a contemporary audience than the other. The Chimes features goblins, whereas "A Christmas Carol" has abstract ethereal spirits which remain timeless. But goblins? Dickens was enamoured of his goblins. They crop up all over the place in his writings. Yet now they are consigned to Fantasy fiction and the mention of them in a novel about social conditions and conscience makes us look askance. We are not quite so engaged, and more likely to look for external reasons for a character's being beset by goblins.The passages starting,"Heaven preserve us, sitting snugly round the fire! It has an awful voice, that wind at Midnight, singing in a church!" describing the wind in the church in winter are very atmospheric, and there is some evidence of Dickens's trademark whimsical humour. But the balance of this story is not right. It is not nearly as enjoyable as "A Christmas Carol". Dickens seems too overly concerned with his moral points, and his indignant attempts to highlight the current social ills, to appeal to a modern audience. There is rather too much acrimony, satire and grim description. Perhaps he was aware of this even at the time it was written. Initially the story was apparently a big success, but by the time it appeared with the other four novels, Dickens had written this apologetic preface, which seems to be him excusing himself for any - or perhaps all - little stylistic defects,"The narrow space within which it was necessary to confine these Christmas Stories when they were originally published, rendered their construction a matter of some difficulty, and almost necessitated what is peculiar in their machinery. I could not attempt great elaboration of detail, in the working out of character within such limits. My chief purpose was, in a whimsical kind of masque which the good humour of the season justified, to awaken some loving and forbearing thoughts, never out of season in a Christian land."There is a happy ending of sorts. After all, we have been assured by the bells that this was a dream. But contrast it with the dream of "A Christmas Carol". With that story we delight along with Ebenezer Scrooge in his changed character, Bob Cratchit's fortune, and Tiny Tim not dying after all. But in The Chimes we are more circumspect; more likely to feel apprehensive and rather sober. It is not an uplifting tale, and we do not feel that the characters in it will be able to fulfil both their and the author's hopeful - but unrealistic - expectations. But to finish, here is Trotty Veck's optimism,On New Year's Day, the best and brightest day in the year!Cheer up! Don't give way. A new heart for a New Year, always!I know that our inheritance is held in store for us by Time. I know there is a sea of Time to rise one day, before which all who wrong us or oppress us will be swept away like leaves. I see it, on the flow! I know that we must trust and hope, and neither doubt ourselves, nor doubt the good in one another. I have learnt it from the creature dearest to my heart.

The first was A Christmas Carol.This is a story that examines a different kind of moral.

      The Cricket on the Hearth

reviews:
	1.Merry Christmas!Everyone in our time knows about Charles Dickens’ magnificent A Christmas Carol, but he actually produced five Christmas themed stories in the 1840s, A Christmas Carol being the first.The Cricket on the Hearth, the third in this series, is less otherworldly than its more famous predecessor, but has magical realism elements with the Cricket as a guardian spirit and references to spirits and faeries. Charmingly domestic, this tells a simple story of love lost and found again as only the inimitable Mr. Dickens can. Loyal readers of his prose will also enjoy many other ubiquitous qualities of his writing such as complex characters (and wickedly appropriate names) social observation and comment and the long lost traveller surreptitiously come home.This one may not be as timeless as other of his stories, its charm is just as good. A recurring theme is class distinction and this may make this one relevant for our time as well.Delightful.

The kettle began it, full five minutes by the little waxy-faced Dutch clock in the corner, before the Cricket uttered a chirp."So begins The Cricket on the Hearth: A Fairy Tale of Home, and straightaway we can tell that this will be a light-hearted piece. Who else could start a novella with such aggrieved indignation by ... well we never really do learn who the narrator is. But right at the start we find ourselves in the middle of an argument between a kettle and a cricket, and it is hilarious—a real joy to read. Dickens loves to give inanimate objects life. He frequently turns a house or a chair into a quirky character with its own presence. Here is Dickens writing to his friend and mentor John Forster, of how he envisaged this charming story,"... a delicate and beautiful fancy for a Christmas book, making the cricket a little household god—silent in the wrong and sorrow of the tale, and loud again when all went well and happy"And this is what begins to unfold before our eyes. A dialogue between a simple kettle and a magical cricket threads all through the story; household fairies, goblins and sprites abound, all centring around an old-fashioned hearth with an open fire, belonging to a bygone age but epitomising home, domesticity and comfort. We have wonderfully drawn characters, a mystery to solve—and we certainly do have "wrong and sorrow". The whole elaborate confection is imbued with a fairytale quality.John and Dot "beaming, useful, busy little Dot—" Peerybingle, now there's a name to instil some joyful Christmas cheer. We quickly learn however that their marriage is threatened by a wide difference in their ages. This is a favourite theme of Dickens, an older husband and younger wife; the older man seeming to be a bit of a plodder and the younger wife being more vivacious and having a bit more more spirit. But who is this mysterious stranger who arrives? Here begins the element of mystery which Dickens always conjures up so well. Are there hints that Dot recognises this unexpected visitor?Before long we are introduced to the Ogre of the piece: a hard-hearted toymaker called Tackleton. Or "pretty generally known as Gruff and Tackleton—for that was the firm, though Gruff had been bought out long ago; only leaving his name, and as some said his nature ..."But wait, how can a toymaker be an Ogre? Read this and all will become clear,"Tackleton the Toy-merchant, was a man whose vocation had been quite misunderstood by his Parents and Guardians ... cramped and chafing in the peaceable pursuit of toymaking, he was a domestic Ogre, who had been living on children all his life, and was their implacable enemy. He despised all toys ... delighted, in his malice, to insinuate grim expressions into the faces of brown-paper farmers who drove pigs to market ... movable old ladies who darned stockings or carved pies; and other like samples of his stock in trade. In appalling masks; hideous, hairy, red-eyed Jacks in Boxes; Vampire Kites; demoniacal Tumblers who wouldn’t lie down, and were perpetually flying forward, to stare infants out of countenance; his soul perfectly revelled."What an inspiration for a villain: someone who delighted in creating toys with horrible faces, and expressions which would terrify their young owners! Of course he also happens to have a none too attractive appearance and manner, and to top it off is about to marry a young innocent girl.As well as the merry Peerybingles and gruff old Tackleton, we have hilarious cameos in the shape of the family dog, Boxer, and Tilly Slowboy, Mrs. Peerybingle's nursemaid. Tilly Slowboy is certainly "slow"; a great clumsy oaf of a girl, who seems to inadvertently use the baby as a battering ram at every opportunity,"Miss Slowboy, in her little errors of judgment, may be said to have done equal honour to her head and to her heart ... though these did less honour to the baby’s head, which they were the occasional means of bringing into contact with deal doors, dressers, stair-rails, bed-posts, and other foreign substances ... she had a rare and surprising talent for getting this baby into difficulties: and had several times imperilled its short life, in a quiet way peculiarly her own."There are many instances of Tilly Slowboy's antics as the text moves on, making for a very lively read. Tilly may be hitting the baby's head on something or losing "it" (the baby is always described as an object) under the grate. You may well find yourself laughing laughing out loud.We then move on to a centre section; the "Second Chirp". Here is another household comprising old Caleb Plummer, a poor dollmaker working for Tackleton, and his blind daughter Bertha. This part is significantly full of pathos, and if it feels at all over-sentimental, it is worth remembering that Victorians believed such disabilities as blindness were inherited. Dickens's portrayal of the yearning feelings of Bertha, is thus a deliberate way of building yet more tension in the story, because it was not very socially acceptable for the blind to marry. By now we have several relationships which appear to have complications and problems beneath the surface. There are at least two deceptions. One seems well-meaning, appealing to our emotions despite our trepidation, but the other could indicate treachery. That one is shrouded in doubt and uncertainty.As the story proceeds, (view spoiler)[ John is shown what appears to be proof of Dot's infidelity (hide spoiler)], and so he consults the spirit of the Cricket on the Hearth. Earlier in the novel Dot had said she liked the the chirping of the cricket, as it would bring luck. The cricket is revealed centre stage,"The Cricket on the Hearth came out into the room, and stood in Fairy shape before him"and a Voice tells John that all will be well. In in the end all the worry which John and others had is proved to be a misunderstanding. Everything falls nicely into place, and the couple are once more blissfully happy, and their friends join them. Happiness abounds, and there is even a surprise moral conversion of one character, on the lines of Ebenezer Scrooge's in "A Christmas Carol". Towards the conclusion, everything is sweetness and light, dancing, gaiety and good humour. The ending of the story has a wistful dream-like quality, as the scene winds down, and the story slowly refocuses,"Hark! how the Cricket joins the music with its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp; and how the kettle hums!"As the narrator watches, his bright vision "... vanished into air, and I am left alone. A Cricket sings upon the Hearth; a broken child’s-toy lies upon the ground; and nothing else remains."The Cricket on the Hearth: A Fairy Tale of Home is the third of Charles Dickens's five "Christmas Books". Unlike Dickens's novels, which were all initially published in serial form, the Christmas Books were all first published as books, a year apart. This one was first published as a novella on 20th December 1845. The first three Christmas books were the centrepiece of Dickens's public reading tours in the 1850s and 60s. Seventeen stage productions opened during the first Christmas season alone. One production actually opened on the same day as the book's release. For many years The Cricket on the Hearth: A Fairy Tale of Home was more popular on stage than "A Christmas Carol"! Victorian readers found its depiction of a happy home very attractive; this was a Victorian ideal. Nowadays however, a domestic setting focusing on the concerns of the home can seem banal, and this novella is sadly sometimes considered sentimental.In his first Christmas book "A Christmas Carol", Dickens had divided into his novella into chapters called "Staves"; in the second, "The Chimes" he named them "Quarters". Here, in The Cricket on the Hearth he whimsically calls them "Chirps". In fact "whimsical" is a word which springs to mind to describe the whole content of this book. Although these first three were all phenomenally popular at the time, only the supremely optimistic "A Christmas Carol" has kept its reputation as a perfect Christmas story. "The Chimes" in many ways was a very topical story, directly about the social problems of the 1840s. Although we can easily relate to its broad message, it now seems less relevant, and some specific references are often missed. Overall now readers often consider it too depressing and downbeat.With The Cricket on the Hearth Dickens has returned to a more lighthearted tone. The bitter sardonic voice of the author has gone, along with the harsh descriptions, and we are back to a scenario which Dickens himself describes as "quiet and domestic ... innocent and pretty." The public loved it, and it quickly went through two editions. William Makepeace Thackeray said,"To us, it appears it is a good Christmas book, illuminated with extra gas, crammed with extra bonbons, French plums and sweetness ... This story is no more a real story than Peerybingle is a real name!"And here we have the crux of the matter. Do not expect the satirical side of Dickens here, nor the hectoring lambast he tended to indulge in, especially in the early novels. This is all sweetness and light; the tongue-in-cheek voice of the Dickens who loved his magical sprites, his house fairies, his pretty females and his quaint, comfortable domesticity, his laugh-out-loud cameos, and his happy endings. It is as the subtitle suggests, "A Fairy Tale of Home," and although it is quite sentimental for modern tastes, if you approach it in the right spirit you may enjoy it immensely.The original illustrations were unusually by several different artists: Daniel Maclise, John Leech, Richard Doyle, Clarkson Stanfield and Edwin Henry Landseer. The frontispiece, a lovely engraving by Daniel Maclise, features many of the goblins and fairies that Dickens seemed to love to include for atmosphere and that bit of elusive and inexplicable "magic" — especially around Christmas. The version reviewed here is from 1912, when Pears' Ltd., published Centenary Editions of the first five Christmas books by Dickens, and also commissioned new artists. The illustrations are not caricatures. They are naturalistic monochrome watercolours by L. Rossi, but they are also very fine.

My French ancestry made this especially interesting. I was hooked. I spent many mornings before school reading in that junior high library. I love how good triumphs over evil, but not until tremendous trial has been gone through. From Oliver Twist to Great Expectations one is never disappointed. Mr. Dickens is amazing and addictive.

      The Life of Our Lord: Written for His Children During the Years 1846 to 1849

reviews:
	1.Originally written for the private edification of his children (the children that he later abandoned when he separated from his wife to live out his days with a mistress), this retelling of the Gospels is a victorian nightmare theologically. Dickens removes Christ's miracles and all messages about sin and repentance, altering the Lord's mission on earth to comforting the downtrodden--making them feel good and helping them to greater prosperity. This little book ends up being less a representation of God's truth and more a kind of desperate and pragmatic nominalism (though more fearful and less pragmatic than that of someone like Matthew Arnold): in the wake of Darwinist theory's arrival and acceptance, the faith of many learned Englishmen was radically undercut, leading them to disbelieve the supernatural and the sacred. As a result, a chaotic, atheistic void opened up at their feet and many of them believed it was better for society at large to preserve at least the externals of Christianity as a kind of "golden lie" to comfort the weak-minded and maintain a justification for moral action. The Life of Our Lord is Dickens' appropriation of Christ's life and work to that end. That said, do not be misled into sharing this story with children as "gospel truth," but it makes an interesting and valuable case study in the popular atheism/Averroism of the high Victorian era. 
	2.I've heard that critics hated this book, and I'm not at all surprised. This book should not be stacked up against Dickens' other works of art. It was clearly never meant to be a great literary masterpiece, and you can't expect many critics to get that. This is simply a father explaining the life of Christ to his children, in his own words, using his own interpretations.That is precisely why I loved it so much.

I wish this would have been around when I was a kid to bridge that gap between Sally, Dick, & Jane and the gospel cannon. I absolutely intend to give this to my kids (when they're about 8 or so) to help them begin to foster a love for scripture stories.

	1.Not so 'classic' Charles Dickens Sad to say, this was my first experience with reading Dickens. Might have been better to have read one of his more famous tales as he has, to this day, quite the reputation of being a great writer of the Victorian Era.This novella, compiled by him and edited by him, includes stories from other authors as well as himself. Some being short , some being a bit longer, some ghostly, and others not ghostly at all. But I still found this book very interesting and reading it gave me a chance to obtain a feel for the writing style of Dickens.I will definitely experience this author again. I would recommend, if you are just getting started with Charles Dickens, that you do, as I did not, read one of his more proliferus writings that made him one of the 'literary geniuses' of his era.
	2.Charles Dickens is often credited with having “invented” Christmas as we know it. This claim might be exaggerated (as is argued here), but one can hardly contest the fact that his “Christmas novels” are a major contribution not only to the literature of this feast, but also to what might be termed its “social iconography”. Works such as “A Christmas Carol” or “The Chimes” both fed and met the expectations of the periodical-reading public whilst tapping into the tradition of telling ghost stories
	3.Charles Dickens is often credited with having “invented” Christmas as we know it. This claim might be exaggerated (as is argued here), but one can hardly contest the fact that his “Christmas novels” are a major contribution not only to the literature of this feast, but also to what might be termed its “social iconography”. Works such as “A Christmas Carol” or “The Chimes” both fed and met the expectations of the periodical-reading public whilst tapping into the tradition of telling ghost stories during long December nights. “The Haunted House” dates from 1859 and was published in Dickens’s weekly periodical 'All the Year Round'. It is a collective effort featuring contributions from several of Dickens’s friends and regular collaborators. Dickens himself acts as master of ceremonies and provides the frame-story, about a group of acquaintances who spend Christmas at an allegedly haunted house, with an agreement that they recount their experiences on Twelfth Night. Given the title and premise, one would be forgiven for expecting a supernatural work or even a prototype “Haunting of Hill House”. Alas, this is nothing of the sort. Many of the contributors either interpret “haunting” in a metaphorical sense or else merely use the ghost as a “prop” for a totally different sort of tale. Just to give an example, Hesba Stretton writes a moralistic love story whilst George Augustus Sala’s narrator claims to have been visited by “the Ghost of the Ague”, prompting a rather tiresome slapstick piece about a wretch with an uncontrollable tremor.This Hesperus Press edition includes a foreword by novelist and Dickens biographer Peter Ackroyd. He is decidedly lukewarm in his praise for this work, singling out only Dickens’s contributions for their quality. Even about these, he has some serious reservations which are, frankly, justified. Indeed, apart from the background narrative, Dickens contributes a strange and rather uncomfortable story about a group of infants at a school who decide to set up a harem. It is likely that Dickens meant to satirise a contemporary fad for “Orientalism”, but to a modern reader, his tale raises disturbing spectres of both paedophilia and (although Ackroyd does not specifically mention this) racism. Ackroyd still considers the remaining chapters as inferior, and here I beg to differ. I must confess that, except when I’m in the mood for him, I tend to find Dickens’s prose heavy and his humour smug. In The Haunted House, for instance, I much preferred his friend Wilkie Collins’s rollicking seafaring tale or, despite its streak of melodrama, Elizabeth Gaskell’s domestic tragedy about a son who disappoints his simple parents’ expectations. And yes, Adelaide Ann Procter’s “sacred legend in verse” (featuring a nun visited by the Virgin Mary) is over-written at times, but its Medieval setting and deliberate archaisms give it pleasant Pre-Raphaelite and Gothic overtones, not unlike Flaubert’s The Legend of Saint-Julian the Hospitaller. Still, a few ghostly scares would not have been amiss...Visit: https://endsoftheword.blogspot.com/20...

      Sketches by Boz
Rating:

reviews:
	1.Not a novel, but as the title would suggest, a collection of passages or sketches by Charles Dickens (under the pseudonym of ‘Boz’) written between 1833-36 and originally published as individual pieces in newspapers/periodicals before being published collectively in one volume.This collection consists of 56 separate ‘sketches’ and is divided into four sections namely: ‘Our Parish, Scenes, Characters and Tales’. Each one of which providing a descriptive piece about that particular character or scene etc.What is important to note here is that this was written very early in the literary career of Charles Dickens, prior to the publication of his first novel ‘Pickwick Papers’. What Dickens gives us in these ‘sketches’ are vignettes from the past, from his world, from his London and provide us with a fascinating window on (mainly) London society of that time – as seen through the lens of Charles Dickens. What Dickens also gives us is a tantalising glimpse, a hint, a mere taste of his literary genius that was yet to come into fruition.Whilst Dickens pieces in the first three sections of this book provide us with a fascinating insight into society of that time, it is the final section entitled ‘Tales’ that really gives us a feel for the literary delights that were to come ahead (particularly the most notable pieces such as ‘The Black Veil’ and ‘The Drunkards Death’). The pieces in that particular section constitute the most compelling part of the book and feel the closest to the novels that were to follow.‘Sketches by Boz’ does very much feel like a combination of two elements here, in that Dickens is:a.	Practising, honing and fine-tuning his literary craft – doing the ground work and seeing how the pieces fit together, how things work, in preparation for the greater and infinitely more sophisticated things yet to comeb.	Teasing and tantalising the reader with snippets of what was to follow – almost as though he knew what greatness he was yet capable of producingTherefore – ‘Sketches by Boz’ is very much an introduction, a curtain raiser to the brilliance of his novels that were yet to follow.For those of us who have read the novels of Charles Dickens, this collection provides an important addition and insight into Dickens’ craft; for those among us who have not – then this book is not the place to start, nor to be read in place of the great Dickens novels (Great Expectations, Hard Times, Little Dorrit, David Copperfield et al…) but as well as.

	3.[postilla italiana, in fondo]Early Dickens, already Dickens (in pieces) «It would require the pencil of Hogarth to illustrate - our feeble pen is inadequate to describe ...» The first book of Dickens is not a novel nor a collection of short stories (apart from some Tales in the fourth part) but a series of small portraits of people, places and situations of the early 19th-century London, halfway between journalism and essay (the great tradition of 18th- and 19th-century essay…). To read it all below can thus seem rather boring. But it is the perfect bus reading, if you have a daily journey of twenty minutes to go, and you can view out the window and around you people, places and situations of a city today, that sometimes rhyme and sometimes contrast with the 19th-century London.  And you can already appreciate Dickens’s spiced writing, his good-natured irony, his ability to grasp the grotesque aspects of daily life, or create pathos in describing the most unacceptable living conditions. The first part is Our Parish: portraits of typical characters and situations of a typical English parish, with mildly satirical descriptions of the world that constitutes («our parish, which, like all other parishes, is a little world of its own ...»). The second is Scenes, opened by The Streets-Morning and The Streets-Night: plural portraits, with skilled transitions from one to another character or group. Then stores (and their owners), means of transport, entertainments, parliament, the courts and finally a terrible descent into prison (A Visit to Newgate), where we sink in the mind of a condemned, who in the last hours recalls childhood, relives the happy moments of love, falls asleep, dreams, and in the end wakes up: «he is the comdemned felon again, guilty and despairing; and in two hours more will be dead.» Then we have the Characters, opened by Thoughts About People (also when he says he thinks, Dickens immediately begins to tell, with the deduction of a «whole life» from «manner and appearance»), and, in the end, the Tales. The most of them are funny, some are more bitter, but again Dickens chooses to close with the most somber note: the last tale (The Drunkard’s Death) is horrible: an entire life of drunkenness, poverty and absence of all light. And in all that, we have a large drinking of brandy-and-water.Postilla italiana (5 febbraio 2017) In italiano gli Sketches (compresi quelli dei giovani gentiluomini) sono adesso leggibili in tre volumi editi da Mattioli 1885: I Londinesi; Il grande romanzo di Londra; e Amori londinesi. Come scrive oggi Ivan Tassi su «Alias Domenica» questi bozzetti rappresentano «la prima occasione in cui Dickens si presenta sulla scena, seppure sotto mentite spoglie, per reclamare a gran voce i diritti e i poteri di un mago incantatore determinato a esibire sortilegi di prodigiosa affabulazione». Un mago capace di evocare «l’incantesimo della vita quotidiana». E che in un certo senso inizia qui a costruirsi il pubblico per i romanzi che verranno. Sì, direi che sta facendo anche questo.

	1.Powerful short versions of Dickens’ NovelsThis is definitely NOT a book for little children to read.Charles Dickens wrote stories that reflected life in the Victorian era - it was not pretty, or easy, for the poor.Many, if not all, the stories are abbreviated versions of many of his books, or extracts from them, e.g., David Copperfield and A Christmas Carol (Scrooge).I would, however, recommend that children, over the age of 12 years, be encouraged to read them so they find out what life was like in Dickens’ time.It might make them more appreciative of their own lives.See my review also at:https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B...

It acts as a great introduction to the rest of his work, and having read a few of them, it had characters that I was both familiar and unfamiliar with. This will prompt me to explore the novels I haven't read yet. I might make Dickens my author to concentrate on for next year, it's only by reading this that I've rediscovered my love for his writing style.

	2.This book captured my attention because (I must confess) I’m delinquent when it comes to the writings of Charles Dickens. I’ve only read “A Christmas Carol” and that is admittedly sad given the profound impact of (and masterful storytelling in) Dickens’ work. The challenge confronting me is that (excepting “A Christmas Carol”) the works of Dickens tend to be huge bookshelf-cracking tomes, and so I’m seeking a strategy by which to approach his publications – given the time investments involved. Because this is a book that largely consists of excerpts from his various works, I figured it might help me devise a plan of how to tackle Dickens (figuratively.) I believe it did help me in that regard. The book’s theme is how biblical teachings feature in the works of Dickens. While my own reading objectives tend toward the secular, I figured that knowing about the moral conundrums and growth, or lack thereof, of characters would be a good way to understand Dickens’ canon as stories and not only as reflections of religious attitudes. Moral dilemma is, after-all, a central element of storytelling -- universally, and not just with regards to religious or mythological contexts. I feel I was correct in this regard, as well. I did learn about which stories were most likely to appeal to me. I do believe the book was as much about how Dickens (not by himself, by any means, but as part of an artistic and societal movement of the day) influenced the nature of Christianity (both in his time and beyond) as it was about how the Gospel influenced Dickens. I’m not saying this with intent to blaspheme. It’s just that the nature of the problems and how they were approached is very different between the time of ancient Rome and Dickensian London. So, one has a kind of general teaching of being charitable and kind to those less fortunate and it is applied to policy questions that were nonexistent at the time of the Bible or that individuals in the Bible were silent upon.There are three chapters or section to the book. The first looks at attitudes toward the poor. If one knows anything about the works of Charles Dickens, it’s that they virtually all deal with down-and-out characters having to make their way through worlds controlled by (often uncharitable) wealthy people. This was true of my beloved “A Christmas Carol,” but I know it’s also a major feature in “Oliver Twist,” “Great Expectations,” “Bleak House,” “The Old Curiosity Shop,” and others. This first section takes up about half the book. The second section involves the issue of redemption, and it’s about a quarter of the book. The final section is also about twenty-five percent of the book and it looks at living a good life. Each of these chapters has a series of excerpts. Generally, there is a short paragraph of editorial input before each excerpt to explain any necessary background as well as to provide some insight into why the excerpt is included (i.e. how it relates to the book’s theme.) While most of the excerpts come from Dickens’ major novels, it should be pointed out that there are some that come from other works (i.e. nonfiction and short fiction.) There are some artistic drawings that are congruous with expectations of a Dickens book. Otherwise, there’s not much in terms of ancillary matter, though there is a Forward. I didn’t feel anything else was particularly needed (though a timeline of publications and / or an appendix with concise plot summaries might have made the book a bit easier to use.)If you’re interested in learning more about the works of Dickens, I’d recommend this book – particularly (but not necessarily exclusively) if you have interests at the intersection of literature and religion.

	1.Book 1 of Charles Dickens' The Christmas Books is composed of two beautiful classic stories or short novels: A Christmas Carol (1843) and The Chimes (1844). They are old, old works but their messages still sound true even up to now. Also, they are still very readable. In fact, I know some friends who make it a point to read A Christmas Carol every year.A Christmas Carol in Prose Being a Ghost Story of Christmas. 5 STARSThe most popular among the 5 books included in this book, The Christmas Books. Why is my friend reading this yearly? It probably reminds her of the real meaning of Christmas. There is nothing wrong having merriment inside the house say with our loved ones. We give them gifts, we bring out our best recipes, we decorate the house, we play and sing Christmas carols. We celebrate Christmas and the coming of the babe in the manger. However, the activities should not stop there. We real meaning of Christmas is to reach out to the less fortunate people. Like Ebenezer Scrooge, we need to help the family of Little Tim and try to make their Christmas as happy and merry as ours. We should not wait for the three ghosts to come knocking at our doors to awake us and realize that Christmas is really about helping each other and not about material things. Please.The Chimes: A Goblin Story. 4 STARSQuite similar to A Christmas Carol since this came after Dickens got so popular with it. If Carol is set on Christmas Eve, Chimes is set on New Year's Eve. If Carol has the cynical, bitter and indifferent Scrooge, Chimes has the pessimistic Alderman Cute. Cute's putting down attitude on things dampen the spirits of the people around him and so they become pessimists like him and view the world negatively. The Chimes here are the bells near the place where the main protagonist Trotty works and each ringing of the Chimes has some effects to him. Effects that could make him reminiscence of the past or wake him up of his stupor to plan for the future. However, his future as well as his daughter Meg's are both bleak and that negativity is further dampened by Cute. Like Carol, Chimes also ends up happily. Very appropriate holiday reads. I am now looking forward to read Book 2 that includes the three other novellas or short stories in this seemingly beautiful classic The Christmas Books.Merry Christmas, everyone! ho ho ho

	1.The Signal-Man by Charles DickensA signalman tells the narrator of the story about a ghost that appears to him from time to time. And that disturbs him mentally. Every time the spirit appeared, a tragic accident happened on the rail track. Dickens created an eerie atmosphere in this story. A very interesting, tense, and compact tale and, it has an ending I didn't expect.
It was the mental torture of a conscientious man, oppressed beyond endurance by an unintelligible responsibility involving life.
Enjoyable.

The signal man is downcast because he couldn't any train accidents shown by the spectre. One time the signal man is missing as our first person narrator wants to see him. What happened to him? Fine ghost story with some eerie elements in it. A classic and recommended for some spine tingling moments.

Fantastic.Peggotty and her buttons bursting off her clothing so that Davy the child remembers being able to find a trail back to his mother's cottage. Poor Mrs. Copperfield, so slight and so unprepared for Mr. Murdstone and his sister. Those horrible Murdstones with their metallic names, metallic outlooks, and metallic bags. "What is before you, is a fight with the world; and the sooner you begin it, the better."You're evil, Mr. Murdstone. And you sound like the French 'merde' because that's what you are! Mr. Barkis..."Barkis is willing". Mr. Peggotty and that boathouse on the beach. Good-natured Ham. Always hopeful Mr. Micawber. Evil Uriah Heep with those slimy hands. The uppity Steerforths. Cruel Creakle. Befuddled, kite-flying Mr. Dick. "Franklin used to fly a kite. He was a Quaker, or something of that sort, if I am not mistaken. And a Quaker flying a kite is a much more ridiculous object than anybody else."And best of all, Miss Betsey Trotwood. What a character! Her constant fights with the trespassing donkeys, her fervent belief that every dwelling in London would burn to the ground every night, her dressing down of the Murdstones, her practical attitude toward adversity (I thought of Maggie Smith, who perfectly embodied her).

This most personal of Dickens's books is not just his life story, but ours. When he notes: The silent gliding on of my existence - the unseen, unfelt progress of my life...isn't that all of us? In youth we approach life with a fire only to find the days grow shorter as daily life moves along, like a Dutch clock. We all matter, we all play a part, we all have our own adventures and travails. It takes a great author to put it all together."Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six, result happiness.""Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery."NOTE: To preserve my 104 year-old book, I covered it in some wrapping paper. Result - nonstop questions from people asking what the book was, where did I find it, etc. Now the hipsters at the cafe think paper is cool and a book club (with real books) has started. Dickens rules.

	1.This short book has a number of essays by Charles Dickens about walks he took through London. Insomnia caused Dickens to walk the streets at night, but there are also other essays about his time walking the London streets – including one where he becomes separated from his adult companion as a child and believing himself to be lost forever, determines to go off and seek his fortune.Dickens was always interested in social reform and his walks tend to take him to the seedier parts of the capital. During his travels he visits workhouses, children’s hospitals and chats with many of the poor people living on the margins of society. At times I felt some of his writing was a little voyeuristic, but then he admitted to being, “unmanned” by the poverty and hunger of the children he came across, and you were once again drawn in. Obviously, Dickens was a powerful writer and his journalism and eye for detail were (and are) important windows into the poverty of Victorian London. Above all, he treats the companions he talks to as equals and with humanity; never condescending and always interested in human nature. A good read and a nice collection to dip into if you have never read any Dickens before and just want to have an idea of his writing style, before embarking on his, much longer, novels.
	2.Even if you now the City of London very well (like me) you will get new inspiration by joining Dickens on his walks through town. You meet the underprivileged in a working house, come to know the secrets of a betting house, see a children's hospital from the inside and stroll to many places that are still existant today as they were in Dickens' times.

Trading in Death was a brilliant satire on the attraction of funeral marches for the masses (look at the exorbitant prices for watching a coffin pass by back then!). Don't worry, you can also do the walks in bright daylight! Typical Dickens, recommended both to Dickens fans and new readers.

	2.Charles Dickens is often credited with inventing the modern idea of celebrating Christmas, with festive warmth and family games, mountains of presents, food feasts, trees and garlands. He also enjoyed casting a spooky, haunting mood over the holiday. To Dickens, Christmas was not only a time for festive warmth, but one for telling ghostly stories around the hearth, with a cosy fire blazing. Christmas takes place right after the winter solstice, when the weather has dropped colder, and on the longest nights of the year. It seems fitting to be a time for dark examination of the soul, too. For Victorians these ghost stories began to be associated with Christmas time, and the end of the year.The Haunted Man and the Ghost’s Bargain is a curious Christmas Tale. It might almost been seen as the mirror image of “A Christmas Carol”, a darkly weird and bleak story for much of the time, although fear not, Dickens will give us his customary happy ending, of sorts.The beginning though, is decidedly sombre. Just a few sentences in, we have:“Who could have seen his hollow cheek; his sunken brilliant eye; his black-attired figure, indefinably grim, although well-knit and well-proportioned; his grizzled hair hanging, like tangled sea-weed, about his face,—as if he had been, through his whole life, a lonely mark for the chafing and beating of the great deep of humanity,—but might have said he looked like a haunted man?”Moreover, his manner was “taciturn, thoughtful, gloomy, shadowed by habitual reserve”; his voice, “slow-speaking, deep, and grave”.This then, is the character who will be at the centre of our tale. He is a Mr. Redlaw, a teacher of chemistry who often sits brooding over all the wrongs which have been done him, and the grief from his past. This is how we first encounter him, in his room which is “part library and part laboratory … so solitary and vault-like,—an old, retired part of an ancient endowment for students”.The man and the room seem part and parcel of each other. But wait. What is this strange visitation. Is he dreaming the images he sees in the open fire, or is he seeing some spirit or ghost? We know how much Dickens loved his ghosts, phantoms and sprites, and here we have a visitor similar to Ebenezer Scrooge’s Marley. Is this a supernatural agent, an inner vision, a Mr. Hyde to his Jekyll, a Jungian shadow, a doppelganger? Should this perhaps more accurately have been entitled (view spoiler)[“The Man Who Haunted himself” (hide spoiler)]?“an awful likeness of himself …with his features, and his bright eyes, and his grizzled hair, and dressed in the gloomy shadow of his dress …”Indeed, I did wonder that Dickens did not use this title, as this element comes so early in the tale, that it would hardly be a spoiler.It seems as though Dickens himself was having a tussle with this tale, his fifth and final Christmas Book. Unlike the earlier ones which followed on each Christmas, his adoring public had to wait another year for this one. Perhaps he was wearying of the format of a short “Christmas spirit”-themed novel, and the fact that his many annual Christmas stories afterwards were far shorter, tends to bear this out. To his friend and mentor John Forster, he confided:“Would there be any distinctly bad effect in holding this idea over for another twelvemonth? saying nothing whatever till November; and then announcing in the Dombey that its occupation of my entire time prevents the continuance of the Christmas series until next year, when it is purported to be renewed. I am very loath to lose the money. And still more so the leave any gap at Christmas firesides which I ought to fill.”This seems so unlike the Dickens we know, who excelled at juggling several projects at once, that I wondered at the true motives. Was he finding either Dombey or this story particularly difficult to write? I do feel that this story is unique in his oeuvre; there’s nothing quite like it really.The inspiration for The Haunted Man first came to Dickens in Lausanne, at the beginning of 1846. Actually, the ideas for three out of the five Christmas books had come to him whilst abroad, which is strange, as the books themselves feel very English. Yet “The Chimes” was inspired by the bells of Genoa, and the one previous to this, “The Battle of Life” was also written in Lausanne.However, since Forster advised Dickens to wait, he did not actually write The Haunted Man until over a year later, in Broadstairs, during his autumn holiday. He took two months, completing it at the end of November at the Bedford Hotel in Brighton. When writing the first Christmas book, “A Christmas Carol” he had also been writing “Martin Chuzzlewit”, and “The Battle of Life” was written during the early days of “Dombey and Son”.Just as parts of that novel are very dark and downbeat, so for the main part is The Haunted Man. It was staged as a Christmas Eve production of a play in 1862, and one wonders if the dour and sombre tone of the book pervaded this production. Certainly the one dramatisation of it that I have heard missed out the comedic elements completely.For there is brilliant comedy. What would Dickens be without his irrepressible instinct to make everyone laugh at some absurdity, or let out an uncertain giggle after a grim, morose, gloom-ridden description, or tragic, savage, devastating part of the story. Here, Dickens seems conscious of drowning his readers in pessimism, with his lengthy descriptions of Mr. Redlaw and the ancient edifice he inhabits.Before he has allowed the Phantom to be any more than a passing impression, he entertains us with William Swidger, the Keeper of the academic institution, followed shortly by his wife, “Mrs. William … composed and orderly … so placid and neat … a quiet mouse”, often quite “taken off her legs” by inclement weather. There is his father a “venerable old man with long grey hair”, forever insisting “I’m eighty-seven — eighty-seven!” The Swidgers, cheeryfaced, simple, innocent with an excess of bustling readiness for anything, are a perfect antidote to the story’s mood, and so they work their uplifting magic on Mr. Redlaw for a while, as we learn of another inhabitant in the unversity: a young student, who had not wanted his presence to be made known to his teacher.But, the Phantom was not to be gainsaid. It would yet manifest itself:“The room had darkened more and more. There was a very heavy gloom and shadow gathering behind the Chemist’s chair.”Like Scrooge, Redlaw does not want to see the Phantom:“I see you in the fire,” said the haunted man; “I hear you in music, in the wind, in the dead stillness of the night … Why do you come, to haunt me thus?”And we learn the meaning of the subtitle, The Ghost’s Bargain. It is an extraordinary offer, one which the troubled Mr. Redlaw has seemed to crave:“I would forget it if I could! Have I thought that, alone, or has it been the thought of thousands upon thousands, generation after generation? All human memory is fraught with sorrow and trouble.”For the Phantom offers him oblivion; the ability to erase all the memories with which he is so obsessed. Mr. Redlaw does not hesitate:“My memory is as the memory of other men, but other men have not this choice. Yes, I close the bargain. Yes! I WILL forget my sorrow, wrong, and trouble!”And the Phantom adds a bonus. Mr Redlaw’s faculty for erased memories will be shared by all he encounters:“The gift that I have given, you shall give again, go where you will. Without recovering yourself the power that you have yielded up, you shall henceforth destroy its like in all whom you approach. Your wisdom has discovered that the memory of sorrow, wrong, and trouble is the lot of all mankind, and that mankind would be the happier, in its other memories, without it. Go! Be its benefactor!”This is has to be good doesn’t it? Or will it be, as in so many of the fairytales beloved by Dickens, that the fulfillment of a desire, or a wish when granted, becomes a curse? There are three sections: I—The Gift Bestowed, II—The Gift Diffused and III—The Gift Reversed, so it seems from this, quite likely that something will go badly wrong, now that Redlaw has had his memories erased.First though, we meet another delightful family, the Tetterbys. A family who own a newspaper shop, this family had me grinning from ear to ear. The shop which tried so hard to be all things to all people, but actually succeeded at nothing; the tiny man enamoured of his pleasantly amply proportioned wife:“She would have made two editions of himself, very easily. Considered as an individual, she was rather remarkable for being robust and portly; but considered with reference to her husband, her dimensions became magnificent. Nor did they assume a less imposing proportion, when studied with reference to the size of her seven sons, who were but diminutive. In the case of Sally, however, Mrs. Tetterby had asserted herself, at last; as nobody knew better than the victim Johnny, who weighed and measured that exacting idol every hour in the day.”For this “Moloch” (the Canaanite devourer of childhood) of a whopping-sized baby, was carted around every hour of the day, by her adoring older brother Johnny. The four tiniest Tetterby brothers were all at various stages of wildness, and the oldest, Adolphus, varied his daily routine as a newspaper vendor, by altering the vowels in his shouted call, “Morning Pepper” … Morning Pipper”. Whenever the Tetterbys come centre stage, we sit up at the prospect of reading some of Dickens’s funniest writing, and most likeable characters. The Tetterbys are equivalent to the Cratchits, in “A Christmas Carol”. They represent a class and a social group with which Dickens was very familiar; his own family when he was a child. And here their portraits are not as sketchily drawn as the Cratchits, but beautifully filled out.And yet … to me the balance is not right. We soon begin to see the Phantom’s baleful influence, as Mr. Redlaw rightly begins to think of his “gift” as a curse. Whoever he meets, becomes “infected”. We see the wonderful creations Dickens has made us love, become twisted into something dark and evil:“they were fighting now, not only for the soap and water, but even for the breakfast which was yet in perspective. The hand of every little Tetterby was against the other little Tetterbys; and even Johnny’s hand — the patient, much-enduring, and devoted Johnny — rose against the baby! Yes, Mrs. Tetterby, going to the door by mere accident, saw him viciously pick out a weak place in the suit of armour where a slap would tell, and slap that blessed child.”We see them lose all their kindness and goodness of heart; all their sunny-natured optimism. We see them become callous, brutal, bitter and wrathful. “What do I care what people do, or are done to?” We see them lose everything that is the best of humanity.There are exceptions. One is a ragged urchin boy, so completely neglected and separate from society, experiencing “no humanizing touch”, that he functions almost an animal, driven only by the Darwinian instinct for survival. He is the equivalent of “Ignorance” in “A Christmas Carol”. Another is the opposite, (view spoiler)[Milly, so tender-hearted that she is immune to Redlaw’s touch. In fact, owing to her purity and own deeply-felt sorrow, Milly is a catalyst, unknowingly able to counteract and reverse Redlaw’s malignant “gift” (hide spoiler)]. And we learn of course, who the student is, why he was so reticent, and what connection he has with Mr. Redlaw.Redlaw becomes increasingly desolate. He is wretched and lonely, despite his “benevolent gift”. When he sees the Phantom, he begs it to allow others to be free of his curse even if he must remain under the curse of forgotten memories himself. He describes himself as: “a man without a soul, as incapable of compassion, artistic sensitivity or spiritual understanding, as the abandoned waif whose neglected short life is equally barren of memories.”The Phantom then appears with a shade that looks like someone familiar to him, directing Redlaw to “seek her out”. She is clearly the key to unlocking the curse of memory loss, although the Phantom does not say how or why.The ending makes us realise why this is a Christmas book. It is an allegorical tale, in which the Phantom helps to effect the moral transformation of Mr. Redlaw. It is the spirit of Christmas which is evoked, rather than any literal interpretation of the Christmas story. Just as Scrooge is taught a lesson and turns his life around, this tale is also about redemption and reconciliation. Once Redlaw’s memories have been restored, he is no longer numb, but feels his emotions and human warmth again. It tells both Redlaw and us, that we need the bad as well as the good; only then do we appreciate what we have. As Dickens wrote to John Forster in 1848:“My point is that bad and good are inextricably linked in remembrance, and that you could not chooser the enjoyment of recollecting only the good. To have all the best of it you must remember the worst also”and in The Haunted Man, Redlaw realises that he:“has lost his memory of sorrow, wrong, and trouble … and with that I have lost all men would remember!”“…but for some trouble and sorrow we should never know half the good there is about us.”Dickens was always very interested in the illustrations to his books, and often quite adamant about what, specifically, he wanted the artist to convey. For The Haunted Man, he commissioned no less than four artists, who had either worked for him before, or were to do so again: John Tenniel, Clarkson Stansfield, Frank Stone and John Leech.Dickens realised that Leech’s strength lay in comedy, and steered him towards the boisterous Tetterby troop, writing:“Bradbury told me you wished to do some comedy … You will find plenty of bits, I trust, in connexion with the Tetterby family”.Although these illustrators excelled in humorous drawings, especially in some of the earlier novels — indeed, there is a lot to be said for each interpretation — I do personally prefer the illustrations in the volume I have reviewed here, which are by Charles Green. This volume is the fifth in the “Pears Centenary edition of Charles Dickens’ Christmas books”, which were published in 1912. Charles Green illustrated four out of the five books, and this one has more than 30 beautifully atmospheric monochrome watercolours, which have an almost photographic quality. They match the moodiness of this piece perfectly, and to me are more apt than the caricatures which suit some of his other work so well.I do feel that this is a dark piece overall. Dickens has largely moved away from the domestic sentiment and communal cheer of the previous Christmas Books. Although it displays elements which preoccupied Dickens throughout his life, such as his interest in spirits, spectres and ghosts, psychology and doppelgangers, I feel he was exploring a dark side, and allowed this to overshadow the book’s ultimate message. The brooding darkness, for me, was done a little too well.Perhaps Dickens was exorcising his own ghosts. He was all too familiar with traumatic pain from his past. Redlaw tells the Phantom that he was tortured by the memory of the death of his sister. It seem significant then, that Dickens’s own sister, Fanny, had died less than a month before he began his book. He had also, like Redlaw, been rejected by his true love (Maria Beadnell) in his youth.But Dickens’s abiding trauma, which haunted him all his life, dated from his childhood, when he was forced to pawn his books, and drop out of school. He felt abandoned by his family, forced to work in a blacking factory at work he loathed. It has been said that even as an adult, Dickens would weep when passing by the site of the shoe blacking factory from his childhood. Another memory which was never far from the front of his mind, was when he was twelve, and his father was sent to debtor’s prison, the “Marshalsea”. The family was left penniless, the family home was given up, and his mother and all the other children lived in prison with their father. Dickens was money-conscious to the point of being obsessed with making it, for the rest of his life.We see clearly throughout his work, that these vivid childhood memories informed much of his writing, in his politics; his sensitivity to the conditions of the poor, the imprisoned, and the disenfranchised. In The Haunted Man, when Redlaw speaks, we see echoes of Dickens’s own inner anguish:“I am he, neglected in my youth and miserably poor, who strove and suffered and still strove and suffered … No mother’s self-dying love … No father’s counsel aided me … My parents, at the best, were of that sort whose care soon ends, and whose duty is soon done; who cast their offspring loose, early, as birds to theirs; and, if they do well, claim the merit; and, if ill, the pity.”Apparently Dickens once met Dostoevsky, in 1862, at the offices of “All The Year Round” in London. Dostoevsky reported that Dickens told him:“[t]here were two people in him … one who feels as he ought to feel and one who feels the opposite. From the one who feels the opposite I make my evil characters, from the one who feels as a man ought to feel I try to live my life.”Certainly the feelings in this story are akin to the feelings evoked by Dostoevsky, who often explored humanity’s darker side. If Dickens could see himself as having two selves, then perhaps he could also see this as a way to construct a character as well. This does seem to be borne out by other such characters with darker sides, or two distinct selves such as (view spoiler)[Sydney Carton, (hide spoiler)] in “A Tale of Two Cities”, (view spoiler)[Bradley Headstone (hide spoiler)], in “Our Mutual Friend” and (view spoiler)[John Jasper (hide spoiler)] in “The Mystery of Edwin Drood.I find Dostoevsky’s bleakness hard to take, although of course I recognise his greatness. In a similar way, my rating of three stars here is a purely subjective one. Any writing by Dickens, for me, is streets ahead of most other writers. A more objective view may put this at 4 stars. But within his oeuvre, this remains at a middling three star read for me. I can now see why he preferred to keep the idea of the Phantom ambiguous: perhaps an actual ghost rather than Redlaw’s inner demons. Yet it is clearly a very personal story by Dickens, which perhaps answers my question near the beginning of this review: did he find this difficult to write?When talking about his own harrowing past, Dickens said:“I do not write resentfully or angrily, for I know how all these things have worked together to make me what I am.”In The Haunted Man, Dickens is telling us that it is best to forgive, not to forget. But how difficult this must have felt for him personally, given the anguished memories which he constantly had to endure.NOTE: I have now reviewed all five of Dickens's Christmas Books.

	1.I love some of Dickens’ novels, but I absolutely hated these two short stories. They are so boring and painfully uninteresting in thier density; I really struggled with both and just couldn’t get into the plots. Only because this was written by Dickens did I try to read each story multiple times, but it made no difference as I had the same reaction each time. These stories are just awful and unapproachable. If you’ve not read any Dickens then do not start here because there enough to put a reader of Dickens for life, which would be such a shame because Dickens is, of course, a brilliant writer. If you’ve not read any Dickens then I recommend starting with Great Expectations, as it is a wonderful novel. Penguin Little Black Classic- 37 The Little Black Classic Collection by penguin looks like it contains lots of hidden gems. I couldn’t help it; they looked so good that I went and bought them all. I shall post a short review after reading each one. No doubt it will take me several months to get through all of them! Hopefully I will find some classic authors, from across the ages, that I may not have come across had I not bought this collection.

‘’Τhe monstrous thought came into my mind as I perused the fixed eyes and the saturnine face, that this was a spirit, not a man.’’
Charles Dickens. The man who created the kind of Christmas we adore (well, those of us who aren’t boring, obnoxious atheists that is…), the man who elevated the ghost story into the realm of Literature. The great writer, the great man who generously introduced the readers of his time to the reality of their city, who exposed the inequality and injustice inflicted on the weakest members of his society. But, now, we are here for the scary parts...This slim volume contains three spooky masterpieces created by the Master. 
‘’Mistress secretly had great fear of meeting with the likeness of that face - we all had; but there was no such thing. The Madonna and Bambino, San Francisco, San Sebastiano, Venus, Santa Caterina, Angels, Brigands, Friars, Temples ay Sunset, Battles, White Horses, Forests, Apostles, Doges, all my old acquaintance many times repeated? - yes.’’
 
To Be Read at Dusk
: In a palazzo near Genoa, a young woman is visited by the figure of a handsome, mysterious man. What seems like a momentary haunting becomes a very tangible reality when the young man proves to be an actual, very mortal presence in her life. Where else could the legend of the doppelganger find rich ground than in an Italian palazzo, a place where Art meets Life and Life meets the world beyond? Italy is a unique country full of light, joy and singing and beauty. When dusk falls, however, something changes. Being of Italian descent, I’ve often walked the nightly alleys of Rome and Venice, Bologna, Florence and Naples. Shadows move at your side and the past is everywhere, the feeling powerful and very particular. 
‘’What is its warning against?’’, he said, ruminating, with his eyes on the fire, and only by times turning them on me. ‘’What is the danger? Where is the danger? There is danger overhanging somewhere on the Line. Some dreadful calamity will happen. It is not to be doubted this third time, after what has gone before. But surely this is a cruel haunting of me. What can I do?’’
 
The Signalman
: We are all aware of countless legends associated with signalmen who try to warn against terrible accidents and apparitions that mirror impending catastrophe. In this atmospheric story, the narrator meets a distraught signalman, plagued by a figure who warns of danger, struggling to decipher the message and prevent disaster.  
‘’A truthful traveller, who should have seen some extraordinary creature in the likeness of a sea-serpent, would have no fear of mentioning it; but the same traveller, having had some singular presentiment, impulse, vagary of thought, vision (so called), dream or other remarkable mental impressions, would hesitate considerably before he would own to it.’’
 
The Trial For Murder
: A man witnesses a rather unimpressive scene from his window. Two men about to engage in a fight before they walk away as suddenly as they appeared. Yet, it is their faces that turn the incident into a rather off-putting experience. Can a vision, a scene from the past, reveal the perpetrator of a crime? Dickens creates a moving story based on the ages-old conviction that victims return to reveal their murderers.Doppelgangers, premonitions, visions, omens, messages from a world that is so far and yet so close to our own. Three little treasures by one of the greats. 
‘’When you walk along a crowded street- at Frankfurt, Milan, London, Paris - and think that a passing stranger is like your friend Heinrich, and then that another passing stranger is like your friend Heinrich, and so begin to have a strange foreknowledge that presently you’ll meet your friend Heinrich- which you do, though you believed him at Trieste - what do you call that?’’

The couriers begin to talk of ghost stories - but not your ordinary ghosts. One story is of a young wife who has a portentous vision of a dark man that haunts her. The other story is of two twin brothers: when one brother falls ill, he tells the other brother, who is leaving on a long trip, "If I get quite better, I’ll come back and see you before you go. If I don’t feel well enough to resume my visit where I leave it off, why you will come and see me before you go." And apparently he REALLY means it.This is a haunting story (or really three stories: two framed by a third) that can be read on a few different levels. Are there ghosts? Or is it a purely psychological tale, with no real ghosts, just people frightening themselves? Or is Dickens, perhaps, telling us a deeper tale, using symbolism?I was scratching my head over some of the aspects of this tale and how to interpret them, so I went on a Google search and came across the most fascinating essay here: https://journals.openedition.org/jsse.... It’s a little dense and scholarly but has some really intriguing ideas in it. I recommend it if you want to do a deep dive!Group read with the Dickensians! group.

He brought imagination into the winter homes and told his readers that comfort, a cozy fire under the hearth, spiced wine, and a good story made home-staying worthwhile. ...there are strings in the human heart which must never be sounded by another, and drinks that I make myself are those strings in mine.In this collection of his Christmas tales, Dickens combined goodwill with tales of shipwrecks and orphans and traditions. There aren't any ghosts of Christmas past nor the haunted recollections of doomed men. Instead, the reader gets a poverty-stricken man relating his "castle in the air" or a narrator describing the various country inns of Yorkshire, "haunted by the ghost of a tremendous pie".The stories I liked best were the maritime tales of The Wreck Of The Golden Mary and The Perils Of Certain English Prisoners. Reading of adventures on the high seas when the weather outside your own home is cold is always worthwhile....a right little island, a tight little island, a bright little island, a show-fight little island...Not every story whammed me and I probably do love his actual books of Christmas season more (mostly because of the haunted tales), but these were a worthwhile read. Family, friends, rituals.Book Season = Winter (a glass of Smoking Bishop) 
	3.Three stars solely for "A Christmas Carol"; the rest are forgettable or cheesy or both.

	1.Another disappointing book. One can definitely tell, even in this short collection, that Dickens was paid by the word. Damn, so much erroneous text that it feels like it takes ages to read a single page! I read one of these stories (The Signal-Man) last night. *yawn* Better than Ambien. The other two stories (The Haunted House and The Trial for Murder) I read this morning. Fantastic way to start the day. Boring. I wanted to go right back to sleep. I'm sure that back when these were written, they would have been something to cluck over as being scandalously awful (in a good, daring way, as opposed to being just awful now), but the times have changed and stories like these are, well... just not all that interesting now. But, it's a classic, so I guess I'm glad I read it for that reason, if no other. 
	2.Sometimes it’s good to read some classics. Sometimes it just serves to remind the reader of changing times and tastes. This selection was inspired by a modern pastiche of a Victorian scary story from a book I’ve recently read. That one was lovely, actually. And these stories not so much. Maybe it’s something to do with how a modern reader processes written word, after all we don’t dress, speak, eat, behave or communicate in the same way we did in the 19th century, so would be somewhat prepostero

Maybe it’s something to do with how a modern reader processes written word, after all we don’t dress, speak, eat, behave or communicate in the same way we did in the 19th century, so would be somewhat preposterous to expect to read the same. Which isn’t to say all classical literature is difficult to enjoy, some resonate perfectly well with any audience, some remain timeless, but this small collection…not so much. Yes, you can appreciate the use of language and turns of phrase, but in general it was much too dense and chewy to be easily digestible. A classic case of the forest being obscured by the trees, wherein the effort of wading through all the serpentine protracted sentences obscures the plot itself. Maybe it’s my plebeian pedestrian tastes talking or maybe, just maybe these stories just didn’t age the way of wine and cheese, but either way they didn’t work for me. It was a slog to get through, not to mention it took twice the amount of time 60 pages normally require. It might work for you, depending on how you like your ghosts. At least this was free. Chalking it up to an experiment then.
